{"text": "When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem\u2019s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn\u2019t have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew Jackson. If General Jackson hadn\u2019t run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch would never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadn\u2019t? We were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted Atticus. Our father said we were both right.Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley\u2019s strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten his teacher\u2019s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to an impressive age and died rich.It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon\u2019s homestead, Finch\u2019s Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient: modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile.Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full.When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch\u2019s Landing, was the county seat of Maycomb County. Atticus\u2019s office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail. Atticus had urged them to accept the state\u2019s generosity in allowing them to plead Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb\u2019s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father\u2019s profound distaste for the practice of criminal law.During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brother\u2019s education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him, and because of Simon Finch\u2019s industry, Atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer\u2019s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men\u2019s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o\u2019clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.We lived on the main residential street in town\u2014Atticus, Jem and I, plus Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldn\u2019t behave as well as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasn\u2019t ready to come. Our battles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won, mainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem was born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember.Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was the product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to bother him.When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries (within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose\u2019s house two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We were never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell.That was the summer Dill came to us.Early one morning as we were beginning our day\u2019s play in the back yard, Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford\u2019s collard patch. We went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy\u2014Miss Rachel\u2019s rat terrier was expecting\u2014instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he wasn\u2019t much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHey yourself,\u201d said Jem pleasantly.\u201cI\u2019m Charles Baker Harris,\u201d he said. \u201cI can read.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d I said.\u201cI just thought you\u2019d like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin\u2019 I can do it. . . .\u201d\u201cHow old are you,\u201d asked Jem, \u201cfour-and-a-half?\u201d\u201cGoin\u2019 on seven.\u201d\u201cShoot no wonder, then,\u201d said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. \u201cScout yonder\u2019s been readin\u2019 ever since she was born, and she ain\u2019t even started to school yet. You look right puny for goin\u2019 on seven.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m little but I\u2019m old,\u201d he said.Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over, Charles Baker Harris?\u201d he said. \u201cLord, what a name.\u201d\u201c \u2019s not any funnier\u2019n yours. Aunt Rachel says your name\u2019s Jeremy Atticus Finch.\u201dJem scowled. \u201cI\u2019m big enough to fit mine,\u201d he said. \u201cYour name\u2019s longer\u2019n you are. Bet it\u2019s a foot longer.\u201d\u201cFolks call me Dill,\u201d said Dill, struggling under the fence.\u201cDo better if you go over it instead of under it,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201dDill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times on it.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes,\u201d said Jem. \u201cEver see anything good?\u201dDill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning of respect. \u201cTell it to us,\u201d he said.Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duck-fluff; he was a year my senior but I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead.When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than the book, I asked Dill where his father was: \u201cYou ain\u2019t said anything about him.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t got one.\u201d\u201cIs he dead?\u201d\u201cNo . . .\u201d\u201cThen if he\u2019s not dead you\u2019ve got one, haven\u2019t you?\u201dDill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas based on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character parts formerly thrust upon me\u2014the ape in Tarzan, Mr. Crabtree in The Rover Boys, Mr. Damon in Tom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies.But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions, and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole, staring and wondering.The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, one faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low, was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago darkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard\u2014a \u201cswept\u201d yard that was never swept\u2014where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and I had never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down, and peeped in windows. When people\u2019s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in Maycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events: people\u2019s chickens and household pets were found mutilated; although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in Barker\u2019s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked.The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycomb\u2019s principal recreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr. Radley made his living\u2014Jem said he \u201cbought cotton,\u201d a polite term for doing nothing\u2014but Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember.The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another thing alien to Maycomb\u2019s ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather only. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore corsets, men wore coats, children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps and call, \u201cHe-y,\u201d of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did. The Radley house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any; Atticus said yes, but before I was born.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they hung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and went to the picture show; they attended dances at the county\u2019s riverside gambling hall, the Dew-Drop Inn &amp; Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd.One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycomb\u2019s ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, and locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to be done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound and determined they wouldn\u2019t get away with it, so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was. If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radley\u2019s word was his bond, the judge was glad to do so.The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on weekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radley\u2019s boy was not seen again for fifteen years.But there came a day, barely within Jem\u2019s memory, when Boo Radley was heard from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked much about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus\u2019s only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a right to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, \u201cMm mm, mm.\u201dSo Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a neighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The Maycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. Radley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent\u2019s leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but when the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the Tribune. He was thirty-three years old then.Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo wasn\u2019t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not a criminal. The sheriff hadn\u2019t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so Boo was locked in the courthouse basement.Boo\u2019s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem\u2019s memory. Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he didn\u2019t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county.Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time. Atticus said no, it wasn\u2019t that sort of thing, that there were other ways of making people into ghosts.My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radley\u2019s posture was ramrod straight.He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say, \u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radley\u2019s elder son lived in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, people said the house died.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "But there came a day when Atticus told us he\u2019d wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the Radley\u2019s every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch when Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house.\u201cThere goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into,\u201d murmured Calpurnia, and she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out, but it had another think coming: Boo\u2019s elder brother returned from Pensacola and took Mr. Radley\u2019s place. The only difference between him and his father was their ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley \u201cbought cotton,\u201d too. Mr. Nathan would speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand.The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.\u201cWonder what he does in there,\u201d he would murmur. \u201cLooks like he\u2019d just stick his head out the door.\u201dJem said, \u201cHe goes out, all right, when it\u2019s pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her . . . said his head was like a skull lookin\u2019 at her. Ain\u2019t you ever waked up at night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this\u2014\u201d Jem slid his feet through the gravel. \u201cWhy do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at night? I\u2019ve seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin\u2019, and one night I heard him scratching on the back screen, but he was gone time Atticus got there.\u201d\u201cWonder what he looks like?\u201d said Dill.Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch, that\u2019s why his hands were bloodstained\u2014if you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.\u201cLet\u2019s try to make him come out,\u201d said Dill. \u201cI\u2019d like to see what he looks like.\u201dJem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door.Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray Ghost against two Tom Swifts that Jem wouldn\u2019t get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life, Jem had never declined a dare.Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head, for Dill wore him down easily: \u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d Dill said, the first day. \u201cAin\u2019t scared, just respectful,\u201d Jem said. The next day Dill said, \u201cYou\u2019re too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard.\u201d Jem said he reckoned he wasn\u2019t, he\u2019d passed the Radley Place every school day of his life.\u201cAlways runnin\u2019,\u201d I said.But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly weren\u2019t as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that he\u2019d never seen such scary folks as the ones in Maycomb.This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leaned against the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge.\u201cI hope you\u2019ve got it through your head that he\u2019ll kill us each and every one, Dill Harris,\u201d said Jem, when we joined him. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me when he gouges your eyes out. You started it, remember.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still scared,\u201d murmured Dill patiently.Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasn\u2019t scared of anything: \u201cIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t think of a way to make him come out without him gettin\u2019 us.\u201d Besides, Jem had his little sister to think of.When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: \u201cIf I got killed, what\u2019d become of you?\u201d he asked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the Radley Place.\u201cYou gonna run out on a dare?\u201d asked Dill. \u201cIf you are, then\u2014\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cDill, you have to think about these things,\u201d Jem said. \u201cLemme think a minute . . . it\u2019s sort of like making a turtle come out . . .\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d asked Dill.\u201cStrike a match under him.\u201dI told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him.Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful.\u201cAin\u2019t hateful, just persuades him\u2014\u2019s not like you\u2019d chunk him in the fire,\u201d Jem growled.\u201cHow do you know a match don\u2019t hurt him?\u201d\u201cTurtles can\u2019t feel, stupid,\u201d said Jem.\u201cWere you ever a turtle, huh?\u201d\u201cMy stars, Dill! Now lemme think . . . reckon we can rock him. . . .\u201dJem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: \u201cI won\u2019t say you ran out on a dare an\u2019 I\u2019ll swap you The Gray Ghost if you just go up and touch the house.\u201dJem brightened. \u201cTouch the house, that\u2019s all?\u201dDill nodded.\u201cSure that\u2019s all, now? I don\u2019t want you hollerin\u2019 something different the minute I get back.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Dill. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard, then Scout\u2019n\u2019me\u2019ll jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we ain\u2019t gonna hurt him.\u201dWe left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house, and stopped at the gate.\u201cWell go on,\u201d said Dill, \u201cScout and me\u2019s right behind you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d said Jem, \u201cdon\u2019t hurry me.\u201dHe walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head.Then I sneered at him.Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked back.The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement, and the house was still.2Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him off on the five o\u2019clock bus and I was miserable without him until it occurred to me that I would be starting to school in a week. I never looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me, learning their games, following Jem\u2019s red jacket through wriggling circles of blind man\u2019s buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories. I longed to join them.Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by one\u2019s parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem\u2019s pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone.\u201cYou mean we can\u2019t play any more?\u201d I asked.\u201cWe\u2019ll do like we always do at home,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019ll see\u2014school\u2019s different.\u201dIt certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline Fisher, our teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler, then made me stand in the corner until noon.Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and a red-and-white-striped dress. She looked and smelled like a peppermint drop. She boarded across the street one door down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s upstairs front room, and when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a haze for days.Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, \u201cThis says I am Miss Caroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from Winston County.\u201d The class murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region. (When Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, Winston County seceded from Alabama, and every child in Maycomb County knew it.) North Alabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no background.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had long conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and said, \u201cOh, my, wasn\u2019t that nice?\u201dThen she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals, turned to the class and asked, \u201cDoes anybody know what these are?\u201dEverybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year.I suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most of My First Reader and the stock-market quotations from The Mobile Register aloud, she discovered that I was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading.\u201cTeach me?\u201d I said in surprise. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t taught me anything, Miss Caroline. Atticus ain\u2019t got time to teach me anything,\u201d I added, when Miss Caroline smiled and shook her head. \u201cWhy, he\u2019s so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads.\u201d\u201cIf he didn\u2019t teach you, who did?\u201d Miss Caroline asked good-naturedly. \u201cSomebody did. You weren\u2019t born reading The Mobile Register.\u201d\u201cJem says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead of a Finch. Jem says my name\u2019s really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I got swapped when I was born and I\u2019m really a\u2014\u201dMiss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. \u201cLet\u2019s not let our imaginations run away with us, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you tell your father not to teach you any more. It\u2019s best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I\u2019ll take over from here and try to undo the damage\u2014\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d\u201cYour father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now.\u201dI mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers. In the long hours of church\u2014was it then I learned? I could not remember not being able to read hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticus\u2019s moving finger separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws, the diaries of Lorenzo Dow\u2014anything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of first-graders in the schoolyard. He asked how I was getting along. I told him.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have to stay I\u2019d leave. Jem, that damn lady says Atticus\u2019s been teaching me to read and for him to stop it\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Scout,\u201d Jem confronted me. \u201cOur teacher says Miss Caroline\u2019s introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college. It\u2019ll be in all the grades soon. You don\u2019t have to learn much out of books that way\u2014it\u2019s like if you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see?\u201d\u201cYeah Jem, but I don\u2019t wanta study cows, I\u2014\u201d\u201cSure you do. You hafta know about cows, they\u2019re a big part of life in Maycomb County.\u201dI contented myself with asking Jem if he\u2019d lost his mind.\u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell you the new way they\u2019re teachin\u2019 the first grade, stubborn. It\u2019s the Dewey Decimal System.\u201dHaving never questioned Jem\u2019s pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now. The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed \u201cthe,\u201d \u201ccat,\u201d \u201crat,\u201d \u201cman,\u201d and \u201cyou.\u201d No comment seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. I was bored, so I began a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t write in the first grade, we print. You won\u2019t learn to write until you\u2019re in the third grade.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, I guess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the Bible underneath. If I reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar. In Calpurnia\u2019s teaching, there was no sentimentality: I seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me.\u201cEverybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands,\u201d said Miss Caroline, breaking into my new grudge against Calpurnia.The town children did so, and she looked us over.\u201cEverybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk.\u201dMolasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic light. Miss Caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers, nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. She stopped at Walter Cunningham\u2019s desk. \u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d she asked.Walter Cunningham\u2019s face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms. His absence of shoes told us how he got them. People caught hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows. If Walter had owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid-winter. He did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls.\u201cDid you forget your lunch this morning?\u201d asked Miss Caroline.Walter looked straight ahead. I saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw.\u201cDid you forget it this morning?\u201d asked Miss Caroline. Walter\u2019s jaw twitched again.\u201cYeb\u2019m,\u201d he finally mumbled.Miss Caroline went to her desk and opened her purse. \u201cHere\u2019s a quarter,\u201d she said to Walter. \u201cGo and eat downtown today. You can pay me back tomorrow.\u201dWalter shook his head. \u201cNome thank you ma\u2019am,\u201d he drawled softly.Impatience crept into Miss Caroline\u2019s voice: \u201cHere Walter, come get it.\u201dWalter shook his head again.When Walter shook his head a third time someone whispered, \u201cGo on and tell her, Scout.\u201dI turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice already, and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding.I rose graciously on Walter\u2019s behalf: \u201cAh\u2014Miss Caroline?\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Jean Louise?\u201d\u201cMiss Caroline, he\u2019s a Cunningham.\u201dI sat back down.\u201cWhat, Jean Louise?\u201dI thought I had made things sufficiently clear. It was clear enough to the rest of us: Walter Cunningham was sitting there lying his head off. He didn\u2019t forget his lunch, he didn\u2019t have any. He had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day. He had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life.I tried again: \u201cWalter\u2019s one of the Cunninghams, Miss Caroline.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon, Jean Louise?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay, ma\u2019am, you\u2019ll get to know all the country folks after a while. The Cunninghams never took anything they can\u2019t pay back\u2014no church baskets, and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don\u2019t have much, but they get along on it.\u201dMy special knowledge of the Cunningham tribe\u2014one branch, that is\u2014was gained from events of last winter. Walter\u2019s father was one of Atticus\u2019s clients. After a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment, before Mr. Cunningham left he said, \u201cMr. Finch, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll ever be able to pay you.\u201d\u201cLet that be the least of your worries, Walter,\u201d Atticus said.When I asked Jem what entailment was, and Jem described it as a condition of having your tail in a crack, I asked Atticus if Mr. Cunningham would ever pay us.\u201cNot in money,\u201d Atticus said, \u201cbut before the year\u2019s out I\u2019ll have been paid. You watch.\u201dWe watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the back yard. Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps. With Christmas came a crate of smilax and holly. That spring when we found a croker-sack full of turnip greens, Atticus said Mr. Cunningham had more than paid him.\u201cWhy does he pay you like that?\u201d I asked.\u201cBecause that\u2019s the only way he can pay me. He has no money.\u201d\u201cAre we poor, Atticus?\u201dAtticus nodded. \u201cWe are indeed.\u201dJem\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cAre we as poor as the Cunninghams?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cNot exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them hardest.\u201dAtticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor. As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunningham\u2019s vexations. The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and the little cash he made went to interest. If he held his mouth right, Mr. Cunningham could get a WPA job, but his land would go to ruin if he left it, and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased. Mr. Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men.As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us with what they had. \u201cDid you know,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cthat Dr. Reynolds works the same way? He charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby. Miss Scout, if you give me your attention I\u2019ll tell you what entailment is. Jem\u2019s definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes.\u201dIf I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would have saved myself some inconvenience and Miss Caroline subsequent mortification, but it was beyond my ability to explain things as well as Atticus, so I said, \u201cYou\u2019re shamin\u2019 him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn\u2019t got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can\u2019t use any stovewood.\u201dMiss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk. \u201cJean Louise, I\u2019ve had about enough of you this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re starting off on the wrong foot in every way, my dear. Hold out your hand.\u201dI thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral contracts. Wondering what bargain we had made, I turned to the class for an answer, but the class looked back at me in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up her ruler, gave me half a dozen quick little pats, then told me to stand in the corner. A storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that Miss Caroline had whipped me.When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again, becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them. Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the Decimal System, appeared at the door hands on hips and announced: \u201cIf I hear another sound from this room I\u2019ll burn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket!\u201dMy sojourn in the corner was a short one. Saved by the bell, Miss Caroline watched the class file out for lunch. As I was the last to leave, I saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arms. Had her conduct been more friendly toward me, I would have felt sorry for her. She was a pretty little thing.3Catching Walter Cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when I was rubbing his nose in the dirt Jem came by and told me to stop. \u201cYou\u2019re bigger\u2019n he is,\u201d he said.\u201cHe\u2019s as old as you, nearly,\u201d I said. \u201cHe made me start off on the wrong foot.\u201d\u201cLet him go, Scout. Why?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any lunch,\u201d I said, and explained my involvement in Walter\u2019s dietary affairs.Walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to Jem and me. His fists were half cocked, as if expecting an onslaught from both of us. I stomped at him to chase him away, but Jem put out his hand and stopped me. He examined Walter with an air of speculation. \u201cYour daddy Mr. Walter Cunningham from Old Sarum?\u201d he asked, and Walter nodded.Walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as blue as Dill Harris\u2019s, were red-rimmed and watery. There was no color in his face except at the tip of his nose, which was moistly pink. He fingered the straps of his overalls, nervously picking at the metal hooks.Jem suddenly grinned at him. \u201cCome on home to dinner with us, Walter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d be glad to have you.\u201dWalter\u2019s face brightened, then darkened.Jem said, \u201cOur daddy\u2019s a friend of your daddy\u2019s. Scout here, she\u2019s crazy\u2014she won\u2019t fight you any more.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too certain of that,\u201d I said. Jem\u2019s free dispensation of my pledge irked me, but precious noontime minutes were ticking away. \u201cYeah Walter, I won\u2019t jump on you again. Don\u2019t you like butterbeans? Our Cal\u2019s a real good cook.\u201dWalter stood where he was, biting his lip. Jem and I gave up, and we were nearly to the Radley Place when Walter called, \u201cHey, I\u2019m comin\u2019!\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "When Walter caught up with us, Jem made pleasant conversation with him. \u201cA hain\u2019t lives there,\u201d he said cordially, pointing to the Radley house. \u201cEver hear about him, Walter?\u201d\u201cReckon I have,\u201d said Walter. \u201cAlmost died first year I come to school and et them pecans\u2014folks say he pizened \u2019em and put \u2019em over on the school side of the fence.\u201dJem seemed to have little fear of Boo Radley now that Walter and I walked beside him. Indeed, Jem grew boastful: \u201cI went all the way up to the house once,\u201d he said to Walter.\u201cAnybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passes it,\u201d I said to the clouds above.\u201cAnd who\u2019s runnin\u2019, Miss Priss?\u201d\u201cYou are, when ain\u2019t anybody with you.\u201dBy the time we reached our front steps Walter had forgotten he was a Cunningham. Jem ran to the kitchen and asked Calpurnia to set an extra plate, we had company. Atticus greeted Walter and began a discussion about crops neither Jem nor I could follow.\u201cReason I can\u2019t pass the first grade, Mr. Finch, is I\u2019ve had to stay out ever\u2019 spring an\u2019 help Papa with the choppin\u2019, but there\u2019s another\u2019n at the house now that\u2019s field size.\u201d\u201cDid you pay a bushel of potatoes for him?\u201d I asked, but Atticus shook his head at me.While Walter piled food on his plate, he and Atticus talked together like two men, to the wonderment of Jem and me. Atticus was expounding upon farm problems when Walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house. Atticus summoned Calpurnia, who returned bearing the syrup pitcher. She stood waiting for Walter to help himself. Walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand. He would probably have poured it into his milk glass had I not asked what the sam hill he was doing.The silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he quickly put his hands in his lap. Then he ducked his head.Atticus shook his head at me again. \u201cBut he\u2019s gone and drowned his dinner in syrup,\u201d I protested. \u201cHe\u2019s poured it all over\u2014\u201dIt was then that Calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen.She was furious, and when she was furious Calpurnia\u2019s grammar became erratic. When in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybody\u2019s in Maycomb. Atticus said Calpurnia had more education than most colored folks.When she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened. \u201cThere\u2019s some folks who don\u2019t eat like us,\u201d she whispered fiercely, \u201cbut you ain\u2019t called on to contradict \u2019em at the table when they don\u2019t. That boy\u2019s yo\u2019 comp\u2019ny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him, you hear?\u201d\u201cHe ain\u2019t company, Cal, he\u2019s just a Cunningham\u2014\u201d\u201cHush your mouth! Don\u2019t matter who they are, anybody sets foot in this house\u2019s yo\u2019 comp\u2019ny, and don\u2019t you let me catch you remarkin\u2019 on their ways like you was so high and mighty! Yo\u2019 folks might be better\u2019n the Cunninghams but it don\u2019t count for nothin\u2019 the way you\u2019re disgracin\u2019 \u2019em\u2014if you can\u2019t act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen!\u201dCalpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack. I retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen, thankful, though, that I was spared the humiliation of facing them again. I told Calpurnia to just wait, I\u2019d fix her: one of these days when she wasn\u2019t looking I\u2019d go off and drown myself in Barker\u2019s Eddy and then she\u2019d be sorry. Besides, I added, she\u2019d already gotten me in trouble once today: she had taught me to write and it was all her fault. \u201cHush you fussin\u2019,\u201d she said.Jem and Walter returned to school ahead of me: staying behind to advise Atticus of Calpurnia\u2019s iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the Radley Place. \u201cShe likes Jem better\u2019n she likes me, anyway,\u201d I concluded, and suggested that Atticus lose no time in packing her off.\u201cHave you ever considered that Jem doesn\u2019t worry her half as much?\u201d Atticus\u2019s voice was flinty. \u201cI\u2019ve no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever. We couldn\u2019t operate a single day without Cal, have you ever thought of that? You think about how much Cal does for you, and you mind her, you hear?\u201dI returned to school and hated Calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentments. I looked up to see Miss Caroline standing in the middle of the room, sheer horror flooding her face. Apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d she screamed.The male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance. Lord, I thought, she\u2019s scared of a mouse. Little Chuck Little, whose patience with all living things was phenomenal, said, \u201cWhich way did he go, Miss Caroline? Tell us where he went, quick! D.C.\u2014\u201d he turned to a boy behind him\u2014\u201cD.C., shut the door and we\u2019ll catch him. Quick, ma\u2019am, where\u2019d he go?\u201dMiss Caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk, but to a hulking individual unknown to me. Little Chuck\u2019s face contracted and he said gently, \u201cYou mean him, ma\u2019am? Yessum, he\u2019s alive. Did he scare you some way?\u201dMiss Caroline said desperately, \u201cI was just walking by when it crawled out of his hair . . . just crawled out of his hair\u2014\u201dLittle Chuck grinned broadly. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no need to fear a cootie, ma\u2019am. Ain\u2019t you ever seen one? Now don\u2019t you be afraid, you just go back to your desk and teach us some more.\u201dLittle Chuck Little was another member of the population who didn\u2019t know where his next meal was coming from, but he was a born gentleman. He put his hand under her elbow and led Miss Caroline to the front of the room. \u201cNow don\u2019t you fret, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no need to fear a cootie. I\u2019ll just fetch you some cool water.\u201dThe cootie\u2019s host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought. He searched the scalp above his forehead, located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger.Miss Caroline watched the process in horrid fascination. Little Chuck brought water in a paper cup, and she drank it gratefully. Finally she found her voice. \u201cWhat is your name, son?\u201d she asked softly.The boy blinked. \u201cWho, me?\u201d Miss Caroline nodded.\u201cBurris Ewell.\u201dMiss Caroline inspected her roll-book. \u201cI have a Ewell here, but I don\u2019t have a first name . . . would you spell your first name for me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know how. They call me Burris\u2019t home.\u201d\u201cWell, Burris,\u201d said Miss Caroline, \u201cI think we\u2019d better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon. I want you to go home and wash your hair.\u201dFrom her desk she produced a thick volume, leafed through its pages and read for a moment. \u201cA good home remedy for\u2014Burris, I want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap. When you\u2019ve done that, treat your scalp with kerosene.\u201d\u201cWhat fer, missus?\u201d\u201cTo get rid of the\u2014er, cooties. You see, Burris, the other children might catch them, and you wouldn\u2019t want that, would you?\u201dThe boy stood up. He was the filthiest human I had ever seen. His neck was dark gray, the backs of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were black deep into the quick. He peered at Miss Caroline from a fist-sized clean space on his face. No one had noticed him, probably, because Miss Caroline and I had entertained the class most of the morning.\u201cAnd Burris,\u201d said Miss Caroline, \u201cplease bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow.\u201dThe boy laughed rudely. \u201cYou ain\u2019t sendin\u2019 me home, missus. I was on the verge of leavin\u2019\u2014I done done my time for this year.\u201dMiss Caroline looked puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dThe boy did not answer. He gave a short contemptuous snort.One of the elderly members of the class answered her: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the Ewells, ma\u2019am,\u201d and I wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt. But Miss Caroline seemed willing to listen. \u201cWhole school\u2019s full of \u2019em. They come first day every year and then leave.

{"text": "\u201cYou try and make me, missus.\u201dLittle Chuck Little got to his feet. \u201cLet him go, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a mean one, a hard-down mean one. He\u2019s liable to start somethin\u2019, and there\u2019s some little folks here.\u201dHe was among the most diminutive of men, but when Burris Ewell turned toward him, Little Chuck\u2019s right hand went to his pocket. \u201cWatch your step, Burris,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d soon\u2019s kill you as look at you. Now go home.\u201dBurris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height, and Miss Caroline took advantage of his indecision: \u201cBurris, go home. If you don\u2019t I\u2019ll call the principal,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to report this, anyway.\u201dThe boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door.Safely out of range, he turned and shouted: \u201cReport and be damned to ye!

He was a real mean one . . . below the belt . . . you ain\u2019t called on to teach folks like that . . . them ain\u2019t Maycomb\u2019s ways, Miss Caroline, not really . . . now don\u2019t you fret, ma\u2019am. Miss Caroline, why don\u2019t you read us a story? That cat thing was real fine this mornin\u2019. . . .Miss Caroline smiled, blew her nose, said, \u201cThank you, darlings,\u201d dispersed us, opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall.When I passed the Radley Place for the fourth time that day\u2014twice at a full gallop\u2014my gloom had deepened to match the house. If the remainder of the school year were as fraught with drama as the first day, perhaps it would be mildly entertaining, but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think of running away.By late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete; when Jem and I raced each other up the sidewalk to meet Atticus coming home from work, I didn\u2019t give him much of a race. It was our habit to run meet Atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance. Atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace; he was full of questions about school. My replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me.Perhaps Calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one: she let me watch her fix supper. \u201cShut your eyes and open your mouth and I\u2019ll give you a surprise,\u201d she said.It was not often that she made crackling bread, she said she never had time, but with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her. She knew I loved crackling bread.\u201cI missed you today,\u201d she said. \u201cThe house got so lonesome \u2019long about two o\u2019clock I had to turn on the radio.\u201d\u201cWhy? Jem\u2019n me ain\u2019t ever in the house unless it\u2019s rainin\u2019.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d she said, \u201cbut one of you\u2019s always in callin\u2019 distance. I wonder how much of the day I spend just callin\u2019 after you. Well,\u201d she said, getting up from the kitchen chair, \u201cit\u2019s enough time to make a pan of cracklin\u2019 bread, I reckon. You run along now and let me get supper on the table.\u201dCalpurnia bent down and kissed me. I ran along, wondering what had come over her. She had wanted to make up with me, that was it. She had always been too hard on me, she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways, she was sorry and too stubborn to say so. I was weary from the day\u2019s crimes.After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called, \u201cScout, ready to read?\u201d The Lord sent me more than I could bear, and I went to the front porch. Atticus followed me.\u201cSomething wrong, Scout?\u201dI told Atticus I didn\u2019t feel very well and didn\u2019t think I\u2019d go to school any more if it was all right with him.Atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers wandered to his watchpocket; he said that was the only way he could think. He waited in amiable silence, and I sought to reinforce my position: \u201cYou never went to school and you do all right, so I\u2019ll just stay home too. You can teach me like Grandaddy taught you \u2019n\u2019 Uncle Jack.\u201d\u201cNo I can\u2019t,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cI have to make a living. Besides, they\u2019d put me in jail if I kept you at home\u2014dose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m feeling all right, really.\u201d\n</p>\n </div>"},
{"text": "\u201cThought so. Now what\u2019s the matter?\u201dBit by bit, I told him the day\u2019s misfortunes. \u201c\u2014and she said you taught me all wrong, so we can\u2019t ever read any more, ever. Please don\u2019t send me back, please sir.\u201dAtticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me.\u201cFirst of all,\u201d he said, \u201cif you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you\u2019ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view\u2014\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201c\u2014until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\u201dAtticus said I had learned many things today, and Miss Caroline had learned several things herself. She had learned not to hand something to a Cunningham, for one thing, but if Walter and I had put ourselves in her shoes we\u2019d have seen it was an honest mistake on her part. We could not expect her to learn all Maycomb\u2019s ways in one day, and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better.\u201cI\u2019ll be dogged,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know no better than not to read to her, and she held me responsible\u2014listen Atticus, I don\u2019t have to go to school!\u201d I was bursting with a sudden thought. \u201cBurris Ewell, remember? He just goes to school the first day. The truant lady reckons she\u2019s carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll\u2014\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Scout,\u201d Atticus said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to bend the law a little in special cases. In your case, the law remains rigid. So to school you must go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see why I have to when he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen listen.\u201dAtticus said the Ewells had been the disgrace of Maycomb for three generations. None of them had done an honest day\u2019s work in his recollection. He said that some Christmas, when he was getting rid of the tree, he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived. They were people, but they lived like animals. \u201cThey can go to school any time they want to, when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cThere are ways of keeping them in school by force, but it\u2019s silly to force people like the Ewells into a new environment\u2014\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t go to school tomorrow, you\u2019d force me to.\u201d\u201cLet us leave it at this,\u201d said Atticus dryly. \u201cYou, Miss Scout Finch, are the common folk. You must obey the law.\u201d He said that the Ewells were members of an exclusive society made up of Ewells. In certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the Ewells\u2019 activities. They didn\u2019t have to go to school, for one thing. Another thing, Mr. Bob Ewell, Burris\u2019s father, was permitted to hunt and trap out of season.\u201cAtticus, that\u2019s bad,\u201d I said. In Maycomb County, hunting out of season was a misdemeanor at law, a capital felony in the eyes of the populace.\u201cIt\u2019s against the law, all right,\u201d said my father, \u201cand it\u2019s certainly bad, but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains. I don\u2019t know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit.\u201d\u201cMr. Ewell shouldn\u2019t do that\u2014\u201d\u201cOf course he shouldn\u2019t, but he\u2019ll never change his ways. Are you going to take out your disapproval on his children?\u201d\u201cNo sir,\u201d I murmured, and made a final stand: \u201cBut if I keep on goin\u2019 to school, we can\u2019t ever read any more. . . .\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really bothering you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dWhen Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something. \u201cDo you know what a compromise is?\u201d he asked.\u201cBending the law?\u201d\u201cNo, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works this way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll concede the necessity of going to school, we\u2019ll go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a bargain?\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll consider it sealed without the usual formality,\u201d Atticus said, when he saw me preparing to spit.As I opened the front screen door Atticus said, \u201cBy the way, Scout, you\u2019d better not say anything at school about our agreement.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authorities.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem and I were accustomed to our father\u2019s last-will-and-testament diction, and we were at all times free to interrupt Atticus for a translation when it was beyond our understanding.\u201cHuh, sir?\u201d\u201cI never went to school,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have a feeling that if you tell Miss Caroline we read every night she\u2019ll get after me, and I wouldn\u2019t want her after me.\u201dAtticus kept us in fits that evening, gravely reading columns of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason, which was reason enough for Jem to spend the following Saturday aloft in the treehouse. Jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not Atticus severed his supply lines. I had spent most of the day climbing up and down, running errands for him, providing him with literature, nourishment and water, and was carrying him blankets for the night when Atticus said if I paid no attention to him, Jem would come down. Atticus was right.4The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first. Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics. What Jem called the Dewey Decimal System was school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques. I could only look around me: Atticus and my uncle, who went to school at home, knew everything\u2014at least, what one didn\u2019t know the other did. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature, elected each time without opposition, innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated on a half-Decimal half-Duncecap basis, seemed to function effectively alone or in a group, but Jem was a poor example: no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books. As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered from Time magazine and reading everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to stay until three o\u2019clock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by, something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a long look around, and went back.Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the side-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my attention.Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in the afternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers.My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley\u2019s Double-Mint.When Jem came home he asked me where I got such a wad. I told him I found it.\u201cDon\u2019t eat things you find, Scout.\u201d\u201cThis wasn\u2019t on the ground, it was in a tree.\u201dJem growled.\u201cWell it was,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was sticking in that tree yonder, the one comin\u2019 from school.\u201d\u201cSpit it out right now!\u201dI spat it out. The tang was fading, anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve been chewin\u2019 it all afternoon and I ain\u2019t dead yet, not even sick.\u201dJem stamped his foot. \u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re not supposed to even touch the trees over there? You\u2019ll get killed if you do!\u201d\u201cYou touched the house once!\u201d\u201cThat was different! You go gargle\u2014right now, you hear me?\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t neither, it\u2019ll take the taste outa my mouth.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2019n\u2019 I\u2019ll tell Calpurnia on you!\u201dRather than risk a tangle with Calpurnia, I did as Jem told me. For some reason, my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship: Calpurnia\u2019s tyranny, unfairness, and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval. On my part, I went to much trouble, sometimes, not to provoke her.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer was our best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying to sleep in the treehouse; summer was everything good to eat; it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape; but most of all, summer was Dill.The authorities released us early the last day of school, and Jem and I walked home together. \u201cReckon old Dill\u2019ll be coming home tomorrow,\u201d I said.\u201cProbably day after,\u201d said Jem. \u201cMis\u2019sippi turns \u2019em loose a day later.\u201dAs we came to the live oaks at the Radley Place I raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knot-hole where I had found the chewing gum, trying to make Jem believe I had found it there, and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil.\u201cI see it, Scout! I see it\u2014\u201dJem looked around, reached up, and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package. We ran home, and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewing-gum wrappers. It was the kind of box wedding rings came in, purple velvet with a minute catch. Jem flicked open the tiny catch. Inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies, one on top of the other. Jem examined them.\u201cIndian-heads,\u201d he said. \u201cNineteen-six and Scout, one of \u2019em\u2019s nineteen-hundred. These are real old.\u201d\u201cNineteen-hundred,\u201d I echoed. \u201cSay\u2014\u201d\u201cHush a minute, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019.\u201d\u201cJem, you reckon that\u2019s somebody\u2019s hidin\u2019 place?\u201d\u201cNaw, don\u2019t anybody much but us pass by there, unless it\u2019s some grown person\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cGrown folks don\u2019t have hidin\u2019 places. You reckon we ought to keep \u2019em, Jem?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what we could do, Scout. Who\u2019d we give \u2019em back to? I know for a fact don\u2019t anybody go by there\u2014Cecil goes by the back street an\u2019 all the way around by town to get home.\u201dCecil Jacobs, who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office, walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the Radley Place and old Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. Mrs. Dubose lived two doors up the street from us; neighborhood opinion was unanimous that Mrs. Dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived. Jem wouldn\u2019t go by her place without Atticus beside him.\u201cWhat you reckon we oughta do, Jem?\u201dFinders were keepers unless title was proven. Plucking an occasional camellia, getting a squirt of hot milk from Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s cow on a summer day, helping ourselves to someone\u2019s scuppernongs was part of our ethnical culture, but money was different.\u201cTell you what,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep \u2019em till school starts, then go around and ask everybody if they\u2019re theirs. They\u2019re some bus child\u2019s, maybe\u2014he was too taken up with gettin\u2019 outa school today an\u2019 forgot \u2019em. These are somebody\u2019s, I know that. See how they\u2019ve been slicked up? They\u2019ve been saved.\u201d\u201cYeah, but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that? You know it doesn\u2019t last.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, Scout. But these are important to somebody. . . .\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that, Jem . . .?\u201d\u201cWell, Indian-heads\u2014well, they come from the Indians. They\u2019re real strong magic, they make you have good luck. Not like fried chicken when you\u2019re not lookin\u2019 for it, but things like long life \u2019n\u2019 good health, \u2019n\u2019 passin\u2019 six-weeks tests . . . these are real valuable to somebody. I\u2019m gonna put \u2019em in my trunk.\u201dBefore Jem went to his room, he looked for a long time at the Radley Place. He seemed to be thinking again.Two days later Dill arrived in a blaze of glory: he had ridden the train by himself from Meridian to Maycomb Junction (a courtesy title\u2014Maycomb Junction was in Abbott County) where he had been met by Miss Rachel in Maycomb\u2019s one taxi; he had eaten dinner in the diner, he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in Bay St. Louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats. He had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt; he was somewhat heavier, no taller, and said he had seen his father. Dill\u2019s father was taller than ours, he had a black beard (pointed), and he was president of the L &amp; N Railroad.\u201cI helped the engineer for a while,\u201d said Dill, yawning.\u201cIn a pig\u2019s ear you did, Dill. Hush,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWhat\u2019ll we play today?\u201d\u201cTom and Sam and Dick,\u201d said Dill. \u201cLet\u2019s go in the front yard.\u201d Dill wanted the Rover Boys because there were three respectable parts. He was clearly tired of being our character man.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m tired of those,\u201d I said.

I slapped it up to the front yard. \u201cI\u2019m first,\u201d I said.Dill said he ought to be first, he just got here.Jem arbitrated, awarded me first push with an extra time for Dill, and I folded myself inside the tire.Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my contradicting him on Hot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me. He did, by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body. Ground, sky and houses melted into a mad palette, my ears throbbed, I was suffocating. I could not put out my hands to stop, they were wedged between my chest and knees. I could only hope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk. I heard him behind me, chasing and shouting.The tire bumped on gravel, skeetered across the road, crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement. Dizzy and nauseated, I lay on the cement and shook my head still, pounded my ears to silence, and heard Jem\u2019s voice: \u201cScout, get away from there, come on!\u201dI raised my head and stared at the Radley Place steps in front of me. I froze.\u201cCome on, Scout, don\u2019t just lie there!\u201d Jem was screaming. \u201cGet up, can\u2019tcha?\u201dI got to my feet, trembling as I thawed.\u201cGet the tire!\u201d Jem hollered. \u201cBring it with you! Ain\u2019t you got any sense at all?\u201dWhen I was able to navigate, I ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring it?\u201d Jem yelled.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get it?\u201d I screamed.Jem was silent.\u201cGo on, it ain\u2019t far inside the gate. Why, you even touched the house once, remember?\u201dJem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the sidewalk, treaded water at the gate, then dashed in and retrieved the tire.\u201cSee there?\u201d Jem was scowling trimphantly. \u201cNothin\u2019 to it. I swear, Scout, sometimes you act so much like a girl it\u2019s mortifyin\u2019.\u201dThere was more to it than he knew, but I decided not to tell him.Calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled, \u201cLemonade time! You all get in outa that hot sun \u2019fore you fry alive!\u201d Lemonade in the middle of the morning was a summertime ritual. Calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then went about her business. Being out of Jem\u2019s good graces did not worry me especially. Lemonade would restore his good humor.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. \u201cI know what we are going to play,\u201d he announced. \u201cSomething new, something different.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Dill.\u201cBoo Radley.\u201dJem\u2019s head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to make me understand he wasn\u2019t afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice.\u201cBoo Radley? How?\u201d asked Dill.Jem said, \u201cScout, you can be Mrs. Radley\u2014\u201d\u201cI declare if I will. I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\u201c \u2019Smatter?\u201d said Dill. \u201cStill scared?\u201d\u201cHe can get out at night when we\u2019re all asleep. . . .\u201d I said.Jem hissed. \u201cScout, how\u2019s he gonna know what we\u2019re doin\u2019? Besides, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.\u201dDill said, \u201cJem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she\u2019s scared.\u201dI was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn\u2019t prove it, and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot Steams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.Jem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.As the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changes every day.Dill was a villain\u2019s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and appear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst performance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem\u2019s assurances that Boo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in the daytime and Atticus home at night.Jem was a born hero.It was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and neighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. Radley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her right forefinger (Dill\u2019s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn\u2019t find any cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.The three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a change; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with the brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, assorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the Radleys than anybody in Maycomb.When it was time to play Boo\u2019s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia\u2019s back was turned, then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, and Jem would fake a plunge into Dill\u2019s thigh. From where I stood it looked real.When Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected. Our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once I saw Miss Maudie Atkinson staring across the street at us, her hedge clippers poised in midair.One day we were so busily playing Chapter XXV, Book II of One Man\u2019s Family, we did not see Atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled magazine against his knee. The sun said twelve noon.\u201cWhat are you all playing?\u201d he asked.\u201cNothing,\u201d said Jem.Jem\u2019s evasion told me our game was a secret, so I kept quiet.\u201cWhat are you doing with those scissors, then? Why are you tearing up that newspaper? If it\u2019s today\u2019s I\u2019ll tan you.\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cNothing what?\u201d said Atticus.\u201cNothing, sir.\u201d\u201cGive me those scissors,\u201d Atticus said. \u201cThey\u2019re no things to play with. Does this by any chance have anything to do with the Radleys?\u201d\u201cNo sir,\u201d said Jem, reddening.\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said shortly, and went inside the house.\u201cJe-m . . .\u201d\u201cShut up! He\u2019s gone in the livingroom, he can hear us in there.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Safely in the yard, Dill asked Jem if we could play any more.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Atticus didn\u2019t say we couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cJem,\u201d I said, \u201cI think Atticus knows it anyway.\u201d\u201cNo he don\u2019t. If he did he\u2019d say he did.\u201dI was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, that\u2019s why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I could just go off and find some to play with.\u201cAll right, you just keep it up then,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201dAtticus\u2019s arrival was the second reason I wanted to quit the game. The first reason happened the day I rolled into the Radley front yard. Through all the head-shaking, quelling of nausea and Jem-yelling, I had heard another sound, so low I could not have heard it from the sidewalk. Someone inside the house was laughing.5My nagging got the better of Jem eventually, as I knew it would, and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while. He still maintained, however, that Atticus hadn\u2019t said we couldn\u2019t, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldn\u2019t, Jem had thought of a way around it: he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldn\u2019t be accused of playing anything.Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming something of a trial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they needed a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while, and on pain of being called a g-irl, I spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch.Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudie\u2019s yard if we kept out of her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and Dill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood, but a relatively benign presence.Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her scuppernongs if we didn\u2019t jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms so generous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their behavior.Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted. She was a widow, a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and men\u2019s coveralls, but after her five o\u2019clock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty.She loved everything that grew in God\u2019s earth, even the weeds. With one exception. If she found a blade of nut-grass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful it\u2019d kill us all if we didn\u2019t stand out of the way.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just pull it up?\u201d I asked, after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high.\u201cPull it up, child, pull it up?\u201d She picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk. Microscopic grains oozed out. \u201cWhy, one sprig of nut-grass can ruin a whole yard. Look here. When it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over Maycomb County!\u201d Miss Maudie\u2019s faced likened such an occurrence unto an Old Testament pestilence.Her speech was crisp for a Maycomb County inhabitant. She called us by all our names, and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eye-teeth. When I admired them and hoped I would have some eventually, she said, \u201cLook here.\u201d With a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework, a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship.Miss Maudie\u2019s benevolence extended to Jem and Dill, whenever they paused in their pursuits: we reaped the benefits of a talent Miss Maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us. She made the best cakes in the neighborhood. When she was admitted into our confidence, every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones, and she would call across the street: \u201cJim Finch, Scout Finch, Charles Baker Harris, come here!\u201d Our promptness was always rewarded.In summertime, twilights are long and peaceful. Often as not, Miss Maudie and I would sit silently on her porch, watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down, watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cMiss Maudie,\u201d I said one evening, \u201cdo you think Boo Radley\u2019s still alive?\u201d\u201cHis name\u2019s Arthur and he\u2019s alive,\u201d she said. She was rocking slowly in her big oak chair. \u201cDo you smell my mimosa? It\u2019s like angels\u2019 breath this evening.\u201d\u201cYessum. How do you know?\u201d\u201cKnow what, child?\u201d\u201cThat B\u2014Mr. Arthur\u2019s still alive?\u201d\u201cWhat a morbid question. But I suppose it\u2019s a morbid subject. I know he\u2019s alive, Jean Louise, because I haven\u2019t seen him carried out yet.\u201d\u201cMaybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get such a notion?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what Jem said he thought they did.\u201d\u201cS-ss-ss. He gets more like Jack Finch every day.\u201dMiss Maudie had known Uncle Jack Finch, Atticus\u2019s brother, since they were children. Nearly the same age, they had grown up together at Finch\u2019s Landing. Miss Maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner, Dr. Frank Buford. Dr. Buford\u2019s profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground, so he stayed poor. Uncle Jack Finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in Nashville and stayed rich. We saw Uncle Jack every Christmas, and every Christmas he yelled across the street for Miss Maudie to come marry him. Miss Maudie would yell back, \u201cCall a little louder, Jack Finch, and they\u2019ll hear you at the post office, I haven\u2019t heard you yet!\u201d Jem and I thought this a strange way to ask for a lady\u2019s hand in marriage, but then Uncle Jack was rather strange. He said he was trying to get Miss Maudie\u2019s goat, that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years, that he was the last person in the world Miss Maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing, and the best defense to her was spirited offense, all of which we understood clearly.\u201cArthur Radley just stays in the house, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you stay in the house if you didn\u2019t want to come out?\u201d\u201cYessum, but I\u2019d wanta come out. Why doesn\u2019t he?\u201dMiss Maudie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou know that story as well as I do.\u201d\u201cI never heard why, though. Nobody ever told me why.\u201dMiss Maudie settled her bridgework. \u201cYou know old Mr. Radley was a foot-washing Baptist\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you are, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cMy shell\u2019s not that hard, child. I\u2019m just a Baptist.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you all believe in foot-washing?\u201d\u201cWe do. At home in the bathtub.\u201d\u201cBut we can\u2019t have communion with you all\u2014\u201dApparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion, Miss Maudie said: \u201cFoot-washers believe anything that\u2019s pleasure is a sin. Did you know some of \u2019em came out of the woods one Saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell?\u201d\u201cYour flowers, too?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am. They\u2019d burn right with me. They thought I spent too much time in God\u2019s outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the Bible.\u201dMy confidence in pulpit Gospel lessened at the vision of Miss Maudie stewing forever in various Protestant hells. True enough, she had an acid tongue in her head, and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good, as did Miss Stephanie Crawford. But while no one with a grain of sense trusted Miss Stephanie, Jem and I had considerable faith in Miss Maudie. She had never told on us, had never played cat-and-mouse with us, she was not at all interested in our private lives. She was our friend. How so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible.\u201cThat ain\u2019t right, Miss Maudie. You\u2019re the best lady I know.\u201dMiss Maudie grinned. \u201cThank you ma\u2019am. Thing is, foot-washers think women are a sin by definition. They take the Bible literally, you know.\u201d\u201cIs that why Mr. Arthur stays in the house, to keep away from women?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Looks like if Mr. Arthur was hankerin\u2019 after heaven he\u2019d come out on the porch at least. Atticus says God\u2019s loving folks like you love yourself\u2014\u201dMiss Maudie stopped rocking, and her voice hardened. \u201cYou are too young to understand it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of\u2014oh, of your father.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "I was shocked. \u201cAtticus doesn\u2019t drink whiskey,\u201d I said. \u201cHe never drunk a drop in his life\u2014nome, yes he did. He said he drank some one time and didn\u2019t like it.\u201dMiss Maudie laughed. \u201cWasn\u2019t talking about your father,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I meant was, if Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn\u2019t be as hard as some men are at their best. There are just some kind of men who\u2014who\u2019re so busy worrying about the next world they\u2019ve never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results.\u201d\u201cDo you think they\u2019re true, all those things they say about B\u2014Mr. Arthur?\u201d\u201cWhat things?\u201dI told her.\u201cThat is three-fourths colored folks and one-fourth Stephanie Crawford,\u201d said Miss Maudie grimly. \u201cStephanie Crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her. I said what did you do, Stephanie, move over in the bed and make room for him? That shut her up a while.\u201dI was sure it did. Miss Maudie\u2019s voice was enough to shut anybody up.\u201cNo, child,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is a sad house. I remember Arthur Radley when he was a boy. He always spoke nicely to me, no matter what folks said he did. Spoke as nicely as he knew how.\u201d\u201cYou reckon he\u2019s crazy?\u201dMiss Maudie shook her head. \u201cIf he\u2019s not he should be by now. The things that happen to people we never really know. What happens in houses behind closed doors, what secrets\u2014\u201d\u201cAtticus don\u2019t ever do anything to Jem and me in the house that he don\u2019t do in the yard,\u201d I said, feeling it my duty to defend my parent.\u201cGracious child, I was raveling a thread, wasn\u2019t even thinking about your father, but now that I am I\u2019ll say this: Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets. How\u2019d you like some fresh poundcake to take home?\u201dI liked it very much.Next morning when I awakened I found Jem and Dill in the back yard deep in conversation. When I joined them, as usual they said go away.\u201cWill not. This yard\u2019s as much mine as it is yours, Jem Finch. I got just as much right to play in it as you have.\u201dDill and Jem emerged from a brief huddle: \u201cIf you stay you\u2019ve got to do what we tell you,\u201d Dill warned.\u201cWe-ll,\u201d I said, \u201cwho\u2019s so high and mighty all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t say you\u2019ll do what we tell you, we ain\u2019t gonna tell you anything,\u201d Dill continued.\u201cYou act like you grew ten inches in the night! All right, what is it?\u201dJem said placidly, \u201cWe are going to give a note to Boo Radley.\u201d\u201cJust how?\u201d I was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me. It was all right for Miss Maudie to talk\u2014she was old and snug on her porch. It was different for us.Jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters. If anyone came along, Dill would ring the bell.Dill raised his right hand. In it was my mother\u2019s silver dinnerbell.\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 around to the side of the house,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWe looked yesterday from across the street, and there\u2019s a shutter loose. Think maybe I can make it stick on the window sill, at least.\u201d\u201cJem\u2014\u201d\u201cNow you\u2019re in it and you can\u2019t get out of it, you\u2019ll just stay in it, Miss Priss!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, but I don\u2019t wanta watch. Jem, somebody was\u2014\u201d\u201cYes you will, you\u2019ll watch the back end of the lot and Dill\u2019s gonna watch the front of the house an\u2019 up the street an\u2019 if anybody comes he\u2019ll ring the bell. That clear?\u201d\u201cAll right then. What\u2019d you write him?\u201dDill said, \u201cWe\u2019re askin\u2019 him real politely to come out sometimes, and tell us what he does in there\u2014we said we wouldn\u2019t hurt him and we\u2019d buy him an ice cream.\u201d\u201cYou all\u2019ve gone crazy, he\u2019ll kill us!\u201dDill said, \u201cIt\u2019s my idea. I figure if he\u2019d come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better.\u201d\u201cHow do you know he don\u2019t feel good?\u201d\u201cWell how\u2019d you feel if you\u2019d been shut up for a hundred years with nothin\u2019 but cats to eat? I bet he\u2019s got a beard down to here\u2014\u201d\u201cLike your daddy\u2019s?\u201d\u201cHe ain\u2019t got a beard, he\u2014\u201d Dill stopped, as if trying to remember.\n</p>\n </div>"},
{"text": "\u201cUh huh, caughtcha,\u201d I said. \u201cYou said \u2019fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard\u2014\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you he shaved it off last summer! Yeah, an\u2019 I\u2019ve got the letter to prove it\u2014he sent me two dollars, too!\u201d\u201cKeep on\u2014I reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform! That\u2019n never showed up, did it? You just keep on tellin\u2019 \u2019em, son\u2014\u201dDill Harris could tell the biggest ones I ever heard. Among other things, he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times, he had been to Nova Scotia, he had seen an elephant, and his grandaddy was Brigadier General Joe Wheeler and left him his sword.\u201cYou all hush,\u201d said Jem. He scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole. \u201cReckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk?\u201d\u201cAnybody who\u2019s brave enough to go up and and touch the house hadn\u2019t oughta use a fishin\u2019 pole,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just knock the front door down?\u201d\u201cThis\u2014is\u2014different,\u201d said Jem, \u201chow many times do I have to tell you that?\u201dDill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to Jem. The three of us walked cautiously toward the old house. Dill remained at the light-pole on the front center of the lot, and Jem and I edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house. I walked beyond Jem and stood where I could see around the curve.\u201cAll clear,\u201d I said. \u201cNot a soul in sight.\u201dJem looked up the sidewalk to Dill, who nodded.Jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole, let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected. The pole lacked several inches of being long enough, and Jem leaned over as far as he could. I watched him making jabbing motions for so long, I abandoned my post and went to him.\u201cCan\u2019t get it off the pole,\u201d he muttered, \u201cor if I get it off I can\u2019t make it stay. G\u2019on back down the street, Scout.\u201dI returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road. Occasionally I looked back at Jem, who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill. It would flutter to the ground and Jem would jab it up, until I thought if Boo Radley ever received it he wouldn\u2019t be able to read it. I was looking down the street when the dinner-bell rang.Shoulder up, I reeled around to face Boo Radley and his bloody fangs; instead, I saw Dill ringing the bell with all his might in Atticus\u2019s face.Jem looked so awful I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him I told him so. He trudged along, dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk.Atticus said, \u201cStop ringing that bell.\u201dDill grabbed the clapper; in the silence that followed, I wished he\u2019d start ringing it again. Atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips. \u201cJem,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat were you doing?\u201d\u201cNothin\u2019, sir.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want any of that. Tell me.\u201d\u201cI was\u2014we were just tryin\u2019 to give somethin\u2019 to Mr. Radley.\u201d\u201cWhat were you trying to give him?\u201d\u201cJust a letter.\u201d\u201cLet me see it.\u201dJem held out a filthy piece of paper. Atticus took it and tried to read it. \u201cWhy do you want Mr. Radley to come out?\u201dDill said, \u201cWe thought he might enjoy us . . .\u201d and dried up when Atticus looked at him.\u201cSon,\u201d he said to Jem, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something and tell you one time: stop tormenting that man. That goes for the other two of you.\u201dWhat Mr. Radley did was his own business. If he wanted to come out, he would. If he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children, which was a mild term for the likes of us. How would we like it if Atticus barged in on us without knocking, when we were in our rooms at night? We were, in effect, doing the same thing to Mr. Radley. What Mr. Radley did might seem peculiar to us, but it did not seem peculiar to him. Furthermore, had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window? Lastly, we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there, we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town\u2014\u201cWe weren\u2019t makin\u2019 fun of him, we weren\u2019t laughin\u2019 at him,\u201d said Jem, \u201cwe were just\u2014\u201d\u201cSo that was what you were doing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cMakin\u2019 fun of him?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cNo,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cputting his life\u2019s history on display for the edification of the neighborhood.\u201dJem seemed to swell a little. \u201cI didn\u2019t say we were doin\u2019 that, I didn\u2019t say it!\u201dAtticus grinned dryly. \u201cYou just told me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou stop this nonsense right now, every one of you.\u201dJem gaped at him.\u201cYou want to be a lawyer, don\u2019t you?\u201d Our father\u2019s mouth was suspiciously firm, as if he were trying to hold it in line.Jem decided there was no point in quibbling, and was silent. When Atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning, Jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyer\u2019s trick on record. He waited a respectful distance from the front steps, watched Atticus leave the house and walk toward town. When Atticus was out of earshot Jem yelled after him: \u201cI thought I wanted to be a lawyer but I ain\u2019t so sure now!\u201d6\u201cYes,\u201d said our father, when Jem asked him if we could go over and sit by Miss Rachel\u2019s fishpool with Dill, as this was his last night in Maycomb. \u201cTell him so long for me, and we\u2019ll see him next summer.\u201dWe leaped over the low wall that separated Miss Rachel\u2019s yard from our driveway. Jem whistled bob-white and Dill answered in the darkness.\u201cNot a breath blowing,\u201d said Jem. \u201cLooka yonder.\u201dHe pointed to the east. A gigantic moon was rising behind Miss Maudie\u2019s pecan trees. \u201cThat makes it seem hotter,\u201d he said.\u201cCross in it tonight?\u201d asked Dill, not looking up. He was constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string.\u201cNo, just the lady. Don\u2019t light that thing, Dill, you\u2019ll stink up this whole end of town.\u201dThere was a lady in the moon in Maycomb. She sat at a dresser combing her hair.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna miss you, boy,\u201d I said. \u201cReckon we better watch for Mr. Avery?\u201dMr. Avery boarded across the street from Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose\u2019s house. Besides making change in the collection plate every Sunday, Mr. Avery sat on the porch every night until nine o\u2019clock and sneezed. One evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last, for he never did it again so long as we watched. Jem and I were leaving Miss Rachel\u2019s front steps one night when Dill stopped us: \u201cGolly, looka yonder.\u201d He pointed across the street. At first we saw nothing but a kudzu-covered front porch, but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light, some ten feet from source to earth, it seemed to us. Jem said Mr. Avery misfigured, Dill said he must drink a gallon a day, and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again, as I was untalented in this area.Dill stretched, yawned, and said altogether too casually, \u201cI know what, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201dHe sounded fishy to me. Nobody in Maycomb just went for a walk. \u201cWhere to, Dill?\u201dDill jerked his head in a southerly direction.Jem said, \u201cOkay.\u201d When I protested, he said sweetly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come along, Angel May.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Remember\u2014\u201dJem was not one to dwell on past defeats: it seemed the only message he got from Atticus was insight into the art of cross examination. \u201cScout, we ain\u2019t gonna do anything, we\u2019re just goin\u2019 to the street light and back.\u201dWe strolled silently down the sidewalk, listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood, listening to the soft night-murmurs of the grown people on our street. Occasionally we heard Miss Stephanie Crawford laugh.\u201cWell?\u201d said Dill.\u201cOkay,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on home, Scout?\u201d\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201dDill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didn\u2019t want to go with them I could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all.\u201cBut why in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight?\u201dBecause nobody could see them at night, because Atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldn\u2019t hear the Kingdom coming, because if Boo Radley killed them they\u2019d miss school instead of vacation, and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime, did I understand?\u201cJem, please\u2014\u201d\u201cScout, I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you for the last time, shut your trap or go home\u2014I declare to the Lord you\u2019re gettin\u2019 more like a girl every day!\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "With that, I had no option but to join them. We thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the Radley lot, we stood less chance of being seen. The fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse.Jem held up the bottom wire and motioned Dill under it. I followed, and held up the wire for Jem. It was a right squeeze for him. \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t get in a row of collards whatever you do, they\u2019ll wake the dead.\u201dWith this thought in mind, I made perhaps one step per minute. I moved faster when I saw Jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight. We came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard. Jem touched it. The gate squeaked.\u201cSpit on it,\u201d whispered Dill.\u201cYou\u2019ve got us in a box, Jem,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get out of here so easy.\u201d\u201cSh-h. Spit on it, Scout.\u201dWe spat ourselves dry, and Jem opened the gate slowly, lifting it aside and resting it on the fence. We were in the back yard.The back of the Radley house was less inviting than the front: a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house; there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors. Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supported one end of the roof. An old Franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch; above it a hat-rack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily.\u201cAr-r,\u201d said Jem softly, lifting his foot.\u201c \u2019Smatter?\u201d\u201cChickens,\u201d he breathed.That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when Dill ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper. We crept to the side of the house, around to the window with the hanging shutter. The sill was several inches taller than Jem.\u201cGive you a hand up,\u201d he muttered to Dill. \u201cWait, though.\u201d Jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist, I grabbed my left wrist and Jem\u2019s right wrist, we crouched, and Dill sat on our saddle. We raised him and he caught the window sill.\u201cHurry,\u201d Jem whispered, \u201cwe can\u2019t last much longer.\u201dDill punched my shoulder, and we lowered him to the ground.\u201cWhat\u2019d you see?\u201d\u201cNothing. Curtains. There\u2019s a little teeny light way off somewhere, though.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get away from here,\u201d breathed Jem. \u201cLet\u2019s go \u2019round in back again. Sh-h,\u201d he warned me, as I was about to protest.\u201cLet\u2019s try the back window.\u201d\u201cDill, no,\u201d I said.Dill stopped and let Jem go ahead. When Jem put his foot on the bottom step, the step squeaked. He stood still, then tried his weight by degrees. The step was silent. Jem skipped two steps, put his foot on the porch, heaved himself to it, and teetered a long moment. He regained his balance and dropped to his knees. He crawled to the window, raised his head and looked in.Then I saw the shadow. It was the shadow of a man with a hat on. At first I thought it was a tree, but there was no wind blowing, and tree-trunks never walked. The back porch was bathed in moonlight, and the shadow, crisp as toast, moved across the porch toward Jem.Dill saw it next. He put his hands to his face.When it crossed Jem, Jem saw it. He put his arms over his head and went rigid.The shadow stopped about a foot beyond Jem. Its arm came out from its side, dropped, and was still. Then it turned and moved back across Jem, walked along the porch and off the side of the house, returning as it had come.Jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us. He flung open the gate, danced Dill and me through, and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards. Halfway through the collards I tripped; as I tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood.Dill and Jem dived beside me. Jem\u2019s breath came in sobs: \u201cFence by the schoolyard!\u2014hurry, Scout!\u201dJem held the bottom wire; Dill and I rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyard\u2019s solitary oak when we sensed that Jem was not with us. We ran back and found him struggling in the fence, kicking his pants off to get loose. He ran to the oak tree in his shorts.Safely behind it, we gave way to numbness, but Jem\u2019s mind was racing: \u201cWe gotta get home, they\u2019ll miss us.\u201dWe ran across the schoolyard, crawled under the fence to Deer\u2019s Pasture behind our house, climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before Jem would let us pause to rest.Respiration normal, the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard. We looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the Radley front gate.\u201cWe better go down there,\u201d said Jem. \u201cThey\u2019ll think it\u2019s funny if we don\u2019t show up.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Mr. Nathan Radley was standing inside his gate, a shotgun broken across his arm. Atticus was standing beside Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Rachel and Mr. Avery were near by. None of them saw us come up.We eased in beside Miss Maudie, who looked around. \u201cWhere were you all, didn\u2019t you hear the commotion?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Jem.\u201cMr. Radley shot at a Negro in his collard patch.\u201d\u201cOh. Did he hit him?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Miss Stephanie. \u201cShot in the air. Scared him pale, though. Says if anybody sees a white nigger around, that\u2019s the one. Says he\u2019s got the other barrel waitin\u2019 for the next sound he hears in that patch, an\u2019 next time he won\u2019t aim high, be it dog, nigger, or\u2014Jem Finch!\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d asked Jem.Atticus spoke. \u201cWhere\u2019re your pants, son?\u201d\u201cPants, sir?\u201d\u201cPants.\u201dIt was no use. In his shorts before God and everybody. I sighed.\u201cAh\u2014Mr. Finch?\u201dIn the glare from the streetlight, I could see Dill hatching one: his eyes widened, his fat cherub face grew rounder.\u201cWhat is it, Dill?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cAh\u2014I won \u2019em from him,\u201d he said vaguely.\u201cWon them? How?\u201dDill\u2019s hand sought the back of his head. He brought it forward and across his forehead. \u201cWe were playin\u2019 strip poker up yonder by the fishpool,\u201d he said.Jem and I relaxed. The neighbors seemed satisfied: they all stiffened. But what was strip poker?We had no chance to find out: Miss Rachel went off like the town fire siren: \u201cDo-o-o Jee-sus, Dill Harris! Gamblin\u2019 by my fishpool? I\u2019ll strip-poker you, sir!\u201dAtticus saved Dill from immediate dismemberment. \u201cJust a minute, Miss Rachel,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of \u2019em doing that before. Were you all playing cards?\u201dJem fielded Dill\u2019s fly with his eyes shut: \u201cNo sir, just with matches.\u201dI admired my brother. Matches were dangerous, but cards were fatal.\u201cJem, Scout,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear of poker in any form again. Go by Dill\u2019s and get your pants, Jem. Settle it yourselves.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dill,\u201d said Jem, as we trotted up the sidewalk, \u201cshe ain\u2019t gonna get you. He\u2019ll talk her out of it. That was fast thinkin\u2019, son. Listen . . . you hear?\u201dWe stopped, and heard Atticus\u2019s voice: \u201c. . . not serious . . . they all go through it, Miss Rachel. . . .\u201dDill was comforted, but Jem and I weren\u2019t. There was the problem of Jem showing up some pants in the morning.\u201c \u2019d give you some of mine,\u201d said Dill, as we came to Miss Rachel\u2019s steps. Jem said he couldn\u2019t get in them, but thanks anyway. We said good-bye, and Dill went inside the house. He evidently remembered he was engaged to me, for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of Jem. \u201cYawl write, hear?\u201d he bawled after us.Had Jem\u2019s pants been safely on him, we would not have slept much anyway. Every night-sound I heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three-fold; every scratch of feet on gravel was Boo Radley seeking revenge, every passing Negro laughing in the night was Boo Radley loose and after us; insects splashing against the screen were Boo Radley\u2019s insane fingers picking the wire to pieces; the china-berry trees were malignant, hovering, alive. I lingered between sleep and wakefulness until I heard Jem murmur.\u201cSleep, Little Three-Eyes?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cSh-h. Atticus\u2019s light\u2019s out.\u201dIn the waning moonlight I saw Jem swing his feet to the floor.\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 after \u2019em,\u201d he said.I sat upright. \u201cYou can\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you.\u201dHe was struggling into his shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve got to.\u201d\u201cYou do an\u2019 I\u2019ll wake up Atticus.\u201d\u201cYou do and I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dI pulled him down beside me on the cot. I tried to reason with him. \u201cMr. Nathan\u2019s gonna find \u2019em in the morning, Jem. He knows you lost \u2019em. When he shows \u2019em to Atticus it\u2019ll be pretty bad, that\u2019s all there is to it. Go\u2019n back to bed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I know,\u201d said Jem. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m goin\u2019 after \u2019em.\u201dI began to feel sick. Going back to that place by himself\u2014I remembered Miss Stephanie: Mr. Nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard, be it nigger, dog . . . Jem knew that better than I.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "I was desperate: \u201cLook, it ain\u2019t worth it, Jem. A lickin\u2019 hurts but it doesn\u2019t last. You\u2019ll get your head shot off, Jem. Please . . .\u201dHe blew out his breath patiently. \u201cI\u2014it\u2019s like this, Scout,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAtticus ain\u2019t ever whipped me since I can remember. I wanta keep it that way.\u201dThis was a thought. It seemed that Atticus threatened us every other day. \u201cYou mean he\u2019s never caught you at anything.\u201d\u201cMaybe so, but\u2014I just wanta keep it that way, Scout. We shouldn\u2019a done that tonight, Scout.\u201dIt was then, I suppose, that Jem and I first began to part company. Sometimes I did not understand him, but my periods of bewilderment were short-lived. This was beyond me. \u201cPlease,\u201d I pleaded, \u201ccan\u2019tcha just think about it for a minute\u2014by yourself on that place\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019d never speak to you again or somethin\u2019 . . .

I unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps. It must have been two o\u2019clock. The moon was setting and the lattice-work shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness. Jem\u2019s white shirt-tail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning. A faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides.He went the back way, through Deer\u2019s Pasture, across the schoolyard and around to the fence, I thought\u2014at least that was the way he was headed. It would take longer, so it was not time to worry yet. I waited until it was time to worry and listened for Mr. Radley\u2019s shotgun. Then I thought I heard the back fence squeak. It was wishful thinking.Then I heard Atticus cough. I held my breath. Sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading. He said he often woke up during the night, checked on us, and read himself back to sleep. I waited for his light to go on, straining my eyes to see it flood the hall. It stayed off, and I breathed again.The night-crawlers had retired, but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred, and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs.There he was, returning to me. His white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger. He came up the back steps, latched the door behind him, and sat on his cot. Wordlessly, he held up his pants. He lay down, and for a while I heard his cot trembling. Soon he was still. I did not hear him stir again.7Jem stayed moody and silent for a week. As Atticus had once advised me to do, I tried to climb into Jem\u2019s skin and walk around in it: if I had gone alone to the Radley Place at two in the morning, my funeral would have been held the next afternoon. So I left Jem alone and tried not to bother him.School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worse\u2014they still flashed cards at you and wouldn\u2019t let you read or write. Miss Caroline\u2019s progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter; however, the usual crew had flunked the first grade again, and were helpful in keeping order. The only thing good about the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as Jem, and we usually walked home together at three o\u2019clock.One afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home, Jem suddenly said: \u201cThere\u2019s something I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201dAs this was his first complete sentence in several days, I encouraged him: \u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cAbout that night.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve never told me anything about that night,\u201d I said.Jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats. He was silent for a while, then he said, \u201cWhen I went back for my breeches\u2014they were all in a tangle when I was gettin\u2019 out of \u2019em, I couldn\u2019t get \u2019em loose. When I went back\u2014\u201d Jem took a deep breath. \u201cWhen I went back, they were folded across the fence . . . like they were expectin\u2019 me.\u201d\u201cAcross\u2014\u201d\u201cAnd something else\u2014\u201d Jem\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cShow you when we get home. They\u2019d been sewed up. Not like a lady sewed \u2019em, like somethin\u2019 I\u2019d try to do. All crooked. It\u2019s almost like\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2014somebody knew you were comin\u2019 back for \u2019em.\u201dJem shuddered. \u201cLike somebody was readin\u2019 my mind . . . like somebody could tell what I was gonna do. Can\u2019t anybody tell what I\u2019m gonna do lest they know me, can they, Scout?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem\u2019s question was an appeal. I reassured him: \u201cCan\u2019t anybody tell what you\u2019re gonna do lest they live in the house with you, and even I can\u2019t tell sometimes.\u201dWe were walking past our tree. In its knot-hole rested a ball of gray twine.\u201cDon\u2019t take it, Jem,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is somebody\u2019s hidin\u2019 place.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Scout.\u201d\u201cYes it is. Somebody like Walter Cunningham comes down here every recess and hides his things\u2014and we come along and take \u2019em away from him. Listen, let\u2019s leave it and wait a couple of days. If it ain\u2019t gone then, we\u2019ll take it, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay, you might be right,\u201d said Jem. \u201cIt must be some little kid\u2019s place\u2014hides his things from the bigger folks. You know it\u2019s only when school\u2019s in that we\u2019ve found things.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cbut we never go by here in the summertime.\u201dWe went home. Next morning the twine was where we had left it. When it was still there on the third day, Jem pocketed it. From then on, we considered everything we found in the knot-hole our property.The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that the older I got the better school would be, that he started off the same way, and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value. The sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning: he went through a brief Egyptian Period that baffled me\u2014he tried to walk flat a great deal, sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him, putting one foot behind the other. He declared Egyptians walked that way; I said if they did I didn\u2019t see how they got anything done, but Jem said they accomplished more than the Americans ever did, they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming, and asked where would we be today if they hadn\u2019t? Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I\u2019d have the facts.There are no clearly defined seasons in South Alabama; summer drifts into autumn, and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter, but turns to a days-old spring that melts into summer again. That fall was a long one, hardly cool enough for a light jacket. Jem and I were trotting in our orbit one mild October afternoon when our knothole stopped us again. Something white was inside this time.Jem let me do the honors: I pulled out two small images carved in soap. One was the figure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress.Before I remembered that there was no such thing as hoodooing, I shrieked and threw them down.Jem snatched them up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he yelled. He rubbed the figures free of red dust. \u201cThese are good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any these good.\u201dHe held them down to me. They were almost perfect miniatures of two children. The boy had on shorts, and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows. I looked up at Jem. A point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part. I had never noticed it before.Jem looked from the girl-doll to me. The girl-doll wore bangs. So did I.\u201cThese are us,\u201d he said.\u201cWho did \u2019em, you reckon?\u201d\u201cWho do we know around here who whittles?\u201d he asked.\u201cMr. Avery.\u201d\u201cMr. Avery just does like this. I mean carves.\u201dMr. Avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week; he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it.\u201cThere\u2019s old Miss Stephanie Crawford\u2019s sweetheart,\u201d I said.\u201cHe carves all right, but he lives down the country. When would he ever pay any attention to us?\u201d\u201cMaybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of Miss Stephanie. If I was him, I would.\u201dJem stared at me so long I asked what was the matter, but got Nothing, Scout for an answer. When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.Less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we enjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped Jem\u2019s memory.The following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to Atticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb County schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus said someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me when I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.Our biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn\u2019t run, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\u201cYou reckon it\u2019s white gold, Jem?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ll show it to Atticus.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were new. \u201cDid you swap with somebody at school?\u201d he asked.\u201cOh, no sir!\u201d Jem pulled out his grandfather\u2019s watch that Atticus let him carry once a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem walked on eggs. \u201cAtticus, if it\u2019s all right with you, I\u2019d rather have this one instead. Maybe I can fix it.\u201dWhen the new wore off his grandfather\u2019s watch, and carrying it became a day\u2019s burdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes.He did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch would not run. \u201cOh-h,\u201d he sighed, \u201cit\u2019ll never go. Scout\u2014?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever\u2019s leaving us these things?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019d be right nice, Jem, we can thank \u2019em\u2014what\u2019s wrong?\u201dJem was holding his ears, shaking his head from side to side. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, I just don\u2019t get it\u2014I don\u2019t know why, Scout . . .\u201d He looked toward the livingroom. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta good mind to tell Atticus\u2014no, I reckon not.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell him for you.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that, Scout. Scout?\u201d\u201cWha-t?\u201dHe had been on the verge of telling me something all evening; his face would brighten and he would lean toward me, then he would change his mind. He changed it again. \u201cOh, nothin\u2019.\u201d\u201cHere, let\u2019s write a letter.\u201d I pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose.\u201cOkay. Dear Mister . . .\u201d\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a man? I bet it\u2019s Miss Maudie\u2014been bettin\u2019 that for a long time.\u201d\u201cAr-r, Miss Maudie can\u2019t chew gum\u2014\u201d Jem broke into a grin. \u201cYou know, she can talk pretty sometimes. One time I asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks, that\u2014chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless,\u201d said Jem carefully. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound nice?\u201d\u201cYeah, she can say nice things sometimes. She wouldn\u2019t have a watch and chain anyway.\u201d\u201cDear sir,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWe appreciate the\u2014no, we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for us. Yours very truly, Jeremy Atticus Finch.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t know who you are if you sign it like that, Jem.\u201dJem erased his name and wrote, \u201cJem Finch.\u201d I signed, \u201cJean Louise Finch (Scout),\u201d beneath it. Jem put the note in an envelope.Next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree. Jem was facing me when he looked up, and I saw him go stark white.\u201cScout!\u201dI ran to him.Someone had filled our knot-hole with cement.\u201cDon\u2019t you cry, now, Scout . . . don\u2019t cry now, don\u2019t you worry\u2014\u201d he muttered at me all the way to school.When we went home for dinner Jem bolted his food, ran to the porch and stood on the steps. I followed him. \u201cHasn\u2019t passed by yet,\u201d he said.Next day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded.\u201cHidy do, Mr. Nathan,\u201d he said.\u201cMorning Jem, Scout,\u201d said Mr. Radley, as he went by.\u201cMr. Radley,\u201d said Jem.Mr. Radley turned around.\u201cMr. Radley, ah\u2014did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI filled it up.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, sir?\u201d\u201cTree\u2019s dying. You plug \u2019em with cement when they\u2019re sick. You ought to know that, Jem.\u201dJem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed to be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.As usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at our steps Jem said, \u201cAtticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.\u201d\u201cWhat tree, son?\u201d\u201cThe one on the corner of the Radley lot comin\u2019 from school.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIs that tree dyin\u2019?\u201d\u201cWhy no, son, I don\u2019t think so. Look at the leaves, they\u2019re all green and full, no brown patches anywhere\u2014\u201d\u201cIt ain\u2019t even sick?\u201d\u201cThat tree\u2019s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?\u201d\u201cMr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin\u2019.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWell maybe it is. I\u2019m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.\u201dAtticus left us on the porch. Jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against it.\u201cDo you itch, Jem?\u201d I asked as politely as I could. He did not answer. \u201cCome on in, Jem,\u201d I said.\u201cAfter while.\u201dHe stood there until nightfall, and I waited for him. When we went in the house I saw he had been crying; his face was dirty in the right places, but I thought it odd that I had not heard him.8For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in Maycomb County, autumn turned to winter that year. We had two weeks of the coldest weather since 1885, Atticus said. Mr. Avery said it was written on the Rosetta Stone that when children disobeyed their parents, smoked cigarettes and made war on each other, the seasons would change: Jem and I were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves.Old Mrs. Radley died that winter, but her death caused hardly a ripple\u2014the neighborhood seldom saw her, except when she watered her cannas. Jem and I decided that Boo had got her at last, but when Atticus returned from the Radley house he said she died of natural causes, to our disappointment.\u201cAsk him,\u201d Jem whispered.\u201cYou ask him, you\u2019re the oldest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you oughta ask him.\u201d\u201cAtticus,\u201d I said, \u201cdid you see Mr. Arthur?\u201dAtticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me: \u201cI did not.\u201dJem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was still touchous about us and the Radleys and it wouldn\u2019t do to push him any. Jem had a notion that Atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker. Jem had no firm basis for his idea, he said it was merely a twitch.Next morning I awoke, looked out the window and nearly died of fright. My screams brought Atticus from his bathroom half-shaven.\u201cThe world\u2019s endin\u2019, Atticus! Please do something\u2014!\u201d I dragged him to the window and pointed.\u201cNo it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing.\u201dJem asked Atticus would it keep up. Jem had never seen snow either, but he knew what it was. Atticus said he didn\u2019t know any more about snow than Jem did. \u201cI think, though, if it\u2019s watery like that, it\u2019ll turn to rain.\u201dThe telephone rang and Atticus left the breakfast table to answer it. \u201cThat was Eula May,\u201d he said when he returned. \u201cI quote\u2014\u2018As it has not snowed in Maycomb County since 1885, there will be no school today.\u2019 \u201dEula May was Maycomb\u2019s leading telephone operator. She was entrusted with issuing public announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and giving first-aid instructions when Dr. Reynolds was away.When Atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of out the windows, Jem asked, \u201cHow do you make a snowman?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cI don\u2019t want you all to be disappointed, but I doubt if there\u2019ll be enough snow for a snowball, even.\u201dCalpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. When we ran to the back yard, it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t walk about in it,\u201d said Jem. \u201cLook, every step you take\u2019s wasting it.\u201dI looked back at my mushy footprints. Jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman. I stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake. It burned.\u201cJem, it\u2019s hot!\u201d\u201cNo it ain\u2019t, it\u2019s so cold it burns. Now don\u2019t eat it, Scout, you\u2019re wasting it. Let it come down.\u201d\u201cBut I want to walk in it.\u201d\u201cI know what, we can go walk over at Miss Maudie\u2019s.\u201dJem hopped across the front yard. I followed in his tracks. When we were on the sidewalk in front of Miss Maudie\u2019s, Mr. Avery accosted us. He had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt.\u201cSee what you\u2019ve done?\u201d he said. \u201cHasn\u2019t snowed in Maycomb since Appomattox. It\u2019s bad children like you makes the seasons change.\u201dI wondered if Mr. Avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance, and reflected that if this was our reward, there was something to say for sin. I did not wonder where Mr. Avery gathered his meteorological statistics: they came straight from the Rosetta Stone.\u201cJem Finch, you Jem Finch!\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cMiss Maudie\u2019s callin\u2019 you, Jem.\u201d\u201cYou all stay in the middle of the yard. There\u2019s some thrift buried under the snow near the porch. Don\u2019t step on it!\u201d\u201cYessum!\u201d called Jem. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, ain\u2019t it, Miss Maudie?\u201d\u201cBeautiful my hind foot! If it freezes tonight it\u2019ll carry off all my azaleas!\u201dMiss Maudie\u2019s old sunhat glistened with snow crystals. She was bending over some small bushes, wrapping them in burlap bags. Jem asked her what she was doing that for.\u201cKeep \u2019em warm,\u201d she said.\u201cHow can flowers keep warm? They don\u2019t circulate.\u201d\u201cI cannot answer that question, Jem Finch. All I know is if it freezes tonight these plants\u2019ll freeze, so you cover \u2019em up. Is that clear?\u201d\u201cYessum. Miss Maudie?\u201d\u201cWhat, sir?\u201d\u201cCould Scout and me borrow some of your snow?\u201d\u201cHeavens alive, take it all! There\u2019s an old peach basket under the house, haul it off in that.\u201d Miss Maudie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cJem Finch, what are you going to do with my snow?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said Jem, and we transferred as much snow as we could from Miss Maudie\u2019s yard to ours, a slushy operation.\u201cWhat are we gonna do, Jem?\u201d I asked.\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cNow get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front. Walk back in your tracks, though,\u201d he cautioned.\u201cAre we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?\u201d\u201cNo, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.\u201dJem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the house, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard.When we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were ready to begin.\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is kind of a mess?\u201d I asked.\u201cLooks messy now, but it won\u2019t later,\u201d he said.Jem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added another load, and another until he had constructed a torso.\u201cJem, I ain\u2019t ever heard of a nigger snowman,\u201d I said.\u201cHe won\u2019t be black long,\u201d he grunted.Jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt.\u201cHe looks like Miss Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips,\u201d I said. \u201cFat in the middle and little-bitty arms.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make \u2019em bigger.\u201d Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach below the figure\u2019s waistline. Jem glanced at me, his eyes twinkling: \u201cMr. Avery\u2019s sort of shaped like a snow man, ain\u2019t he?\u201dJem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on. He permitted me to cover only the back, saving the public parts for himself. Gradually Mr. Avery turned white.Using bits of wood for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons, Jem succeeded in making Mr. Avery look cross. A stick of stovewood completed the picture. Jem stepped back and viewed his creation.\u201cIt\u2019s lovely, Jem,\u201d I said. \u201cLooks almost like he\u2019d talk to you.\u201d\u201cIt is, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he said shyly.We could not wait for Atticus to come home for dinner, but called and said we had a big surprise for him. He seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard, but he said we had done a jim-dandy job. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how you were going to do it,\u201d he said to Jem, \u201cbut from now on I\u2019ll never worry about what\u2019ll become of you, son, you\u2019ll always have an idea.\u201dJem\u2019s ears reddened from Atticus\u2019s compliment, but he looked up sharply when he saw Atticus stepping back. Atticus squinted at the snowman a while. He grinned, then laughed. \u201cSon, I can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re going to be\u2014an engineer, a lawyer, or a portrait painter. You\u2019ve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard. We\u2019ve got to disguise this fellow.\u201dAtticus suggested that Jem hone down his creation\u2019s front a little, swap a broom for the stovewood, and put an apron on him.Jem explained that if he did, the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman.\u201cI don\u2019t care what you do, so long as you do something,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around making caricatures of the neighbors.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cAin\u2019t a characterture,\u201d said Jem. \u201cIt looks just like him.\u201d\u201cMr. Avery might not think so.\u201d\u201cI know what!\u201d said Jem. He raced across the street, disappeared into Miss Maudie\u2019s back yard and returned triumphant. He stuck her sunhat on the snowman\u2019s head and jammed her hedge-clippers into the crook of his arm. Atticus said that would be fine.Miss Maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch. She looked across the street at us. Suddenly she grinned. \u201cJem Finch,\u201d she called. \u201cYou devil, bring me back my hat, sir!\u201dJem looked up at Atticus, who shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s just fussing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s really impressed with your\u2014accomplishments.\u201dAtticus strolled over to Miss Maudie\u2019s sidewalk, where they engaged in an arm-waving conversation, the only phrase of which I caught was \u201c. . . erected an absolute morphodite in that yard! Atticus, you\u2019ll never raise \u2019em!\u201dThe snow stopped in the afternoon, the temperature dropped, and by nightfall Mr. Avery\u2019s direst predictions came true: Calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing, but we were cold. When Atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it, and asked Calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night. Calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought she\u2019d be warmer at her house. Atticus drove her home in the car.Before I went to sleep Atticus put more coal on the fire in my room. He said the thermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest night in his memory, and that our snowman outside was frozen solid.Minutes later, it seemed, I was awakened by someone shaking me. Atticus\u2019s overcoat was spread across me. \u201cIs it morning already.\u201d\u201cBaby, get up.\u201dAtticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat. \u201cPut your robe on first,\u201d he said.Jem was standing beside Atticus, groggy and tousled. He was holding his overcoat closed at the neck, his other hand was jammed into his pocket. He looked strangely overweight.\u201cHurry, hon,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cHere\u2019re your shoes and socks.\u201dStupidly, I put them on. \u201cIs it morning?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s a little after one. Hurry now.\u201dThat something was wrong finally got through to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dBy then he did not have to tell me. Just as the birds know where to go when it rains, I knew when there was trouble in our street. Soft taffeta-like sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread.\u201cWhose is it?\u201d\u201cMiss Maudie\u2019s, hon,\u201d said Atticus gently.At the front door, we saw fire spewing from Miss Maudie\u2019s dining-room windows. As if to confirm what we saw, the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there, screaming.\u201cIt\u2019s gone, ain\u2019t it?\u201d moaned Jem.\u201cI expect so,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cNow listen, both of you. Go down and stand in front of the Radley Place. Keep out of the way, do you hear? See which way the wind\u2019s blowing?\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Jem. \u201cAtticus, reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out?\u201d\u201cNot yet, son. Do as I tell you. Run now. Take care of Scout, you hear? Don\u2019t let her out of your sight.\u201dWith a push, Atticus started us toward the Radley front gate. We stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured Miss Maudie\u2019s house. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they hurry, why don\u2019t they hurry . . .\u201d muttered Jem.We saw why. The old fire truck, killed by the cold, was being pushed from town by a crowd of men. When the men attached its hose to a hydrant, the hose burst and water shot up, tinkling down on the pavement.\u201cOh-h Lord, Jem . . .\u201dJem put his arm around me. \u201cHush, Scout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t time to worry yet. I\u2019ll let you know when.\u201dThe men of Maycomb, in all degrees of dress and undress, took furniture from Miss Maudie\u2019s house to a yard across the street. I saw Atticus carrying Miss Maudie\u2019s heavy oak rocking chair, and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most.Sometimes we heard shouts. Then Mr. Avery\u2019s face appeared in an upstairs window. He pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted, \u201cCome down from there, Dick! The stairs are going! Get outta there, Mr. Avery!\u201dMr. Avery began climbing through the window.\u201cScout, he\u2019s stuck . . .\u201d breathed Jem. \u201cOh God . . .\u201d</p>\n\n</div>"},
{"text": "</p><p>\nMr. Avery was wedged tightly. I buried my head under Jem\u2019s arm and didn\u2019t look again until Jem cried, \u201cHe\u2019s got loose, Scout! He\u2019s all right!\u201dI looked up to see Mr. Avery cross the upstairs porch. He swung his legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped. He fell, yelled, and hit Miss Maudie\u2019s shrubbery.Suddenly I noticed that the men were backing away from Miss Maudie\u2019s house, moving down the street toward us. They were no longer carrying furniture. The fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof: window frames were black against a vivid orange center.\u201cJem, it looks like a pumpkin\u2014\u201d\u201cScout, look!\u201dSmoke was rolling off our house and Miss Rachel\u2019s house like fog off a riverbank, and men were pulling hoses toward them. Behind us, the fire truck from Abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house.\u201cThat book . . .\u201d I said.\u201cWhat?\u201d said Jem.\u201cThat Tom Swift book, it ain\u2019t mine, it\u2019s Dill\u2019s . . .\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Scout, it ain\u2019t time to worry yet,\u201d said Jem. He pointed. \u201cLooka yonder.\u201dIn a group of neighbors, Atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets. He might have been watching a football game. Miss Maudie was beside him.\u201cSee there, he\u2019s not worried yet,\u201d said Jem.\u201cWhy ain\u2019t he on top of one of the houses?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too old, he\u2019d break his neck.\u201d\u201cYou think we oughta make him get our stuff out?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s don\u2019t pester him, he\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time,\u201d said Jem.The Abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house; a man on the roof pointed to places that needed it most. I watched our Absolute Morphodite go black and crumble; Miss Maudie\u2019s sun-hat settled on top of the heap. I could not see her hedge-clippers. In the heat between our house, Miss Rachel\u2019s and Miss Maudie\u2019s, the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes. They worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants, but I became aware that I was slowly freezing where I stood. Jem tried to keep me warm, but his arm was not enough. I pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders. By dancing a little, I could feel my feet.Another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of Miss Stephanie Crawford\u2019s. There was no hydrant for another hose, and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguishers.Miss Maudie\u2019s tin roof quelled the flames. Roaring, the house collapsed; fire gushed everywhere, followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses, beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood.It was dawn before the men began to leave, first one by one, then in groups. They pushed the Maycomb fire truck back to town, the Abbottsville truck departed, the third one remained. We found out next day it had come from Clark\u2019s Ferry, sixty miles away.Jem and I slid across the street. Miss Maudie was staring at the smoking black hole in her yard, and Atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk. He led us home, holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street. He said Miss Maudie would stay with Miss Stephanie for the time being.\u201cAnybody want some hot chocolate?\u201d he asked. I shuddered when Atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove.As we drank our cocoa I noticed Atticus looking at me, first with curiosity, then with sternness. \u201cI thought I told you and Jem to stay put,\u201d he said.\u201cWhy, we did. We stayed\u2014\u201d\u201cThen whose blanket is that?\u201d\u201cBlanket?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am, blanket. It isn\u2019t ours.\u201dI looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket I was wearing around my shoulders, squaw-fashion.\u201cAtticus, I don\u2019t know, sir . . . I\u2014\u201dI turned to Jem for an answer, but Jem was even more bewildered than I. He said he didn\u2019t know how it got there, we did exactly as Atticus had told us, we stood down by the Radley gate away from everybody, we didn\u2019t move an inch\u2014Jem stopped.\u201cMr. Nathan was at the fire,\u201d he babbled, \u201cI saw him, I saw him, he was tuggin\u2019 that mattress\u2014Atticus, I swear . . .\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right, son.\u201d Atticus grinned slowly. \u201cLooks like all of Maycomb was out tonight, in one way or another. Jem, there\u2019s some wrapping paper in the pantry, I think. Go get it and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\u201cAtticus, no sir!\u201dJem seemed to have lost his mind. He began pouring out our secrets right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own, omitting nothing, knot-hole, pants and all.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201c. . . Mr. Nathan put cement in that tree, Atticus, an\u2019 he did it to stop us findin\u2019 things\u2014he\u2019s crazy, I reckon, like they say, but Atticus, I swear to God he ain\u2019t ever harmed us, he ain\u2019t ever hurt us, he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants instead . . . he ain\u2019t ever hurt us, Atticus\u2014\u201dAtticus said, \u201cWhoa, son,\u201d so gently that I was greatly heartened. It was obvious that he had not followed a word Jem said, for all Atticus said was, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019d better keep this and the blanket to ourselves. Someday, maybe, Scout can thank him for covering her up.\u201d\u201cThank who?\u201d I asked.\u201cBoo Radley. You were so busy looking at the fire you didn\u2019t know it when he put the blanket around you.\u201dMy stomach turned to water and I nearly threw up when Jem held out the blanket and crept toward me. \u201cHe sneaked out of the house\u2014turn \u2019round\u2014sneaked up, an\u2019 went like this!\u201dAtticus said dryly, \u201cDo not let this inspire you to further glory, Jeremy.\u201dJem scowled, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna do anything to him,\u201d but I watched the spark of fresh adventure leave his eyes. \u201cJust think, Scout,\u201d he said, \u201cif you\u2019d just turned around, you\u2019da seen him.\u201dCalpurnia woke us at noon. Atticus had said we need not go to school that day, we\u2019d learn nothing after no sleep. Calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard.Miss Maudie\u2019s sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice, like a fly in amber, and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedge-clippers. We found her in her back yard, gazing at her frozen charred azaleas.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing back your things, Miss Maudie,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWe\u2019re awful sorry.\u201dMiss Maudie looked around, and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face. \u201cAlways wanted a smaller house, Jem Finch. Gives me more yard. Just think, I\u2019ll have more room for my azaleas now!\u201d\u201cYou ain\u2019t grievin\u2019, Miss Maudie?\u201d I asked, surprised. Atticus said her house was nearly all she had.\u201cGrieving, child? Why, I hated that old cow barn. Thought of settin\u2019 fire to it a hundred times myself, except they\u2019d lock me up.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me, Jean Louise Finch. There are ways of doing things you don\u2019t know about. Why, I\u2019ll build me a little house and take me a couple of roomers and\u2014gracious, I\u2019ll have the finest yard in Alabama. Those Bellingraths\u2019ll look plain puny when I get started!\u201dJem and I looked at each other. \u201cHow\u2019d it catch, Miss Maudie?\u201d he asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jem. Probably the flue in the kitchen. I kept a fire in there last night for my potted plants. Hear you had some unexpected company last night, Miss Jean Louise.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\u201cAtticus told me on his way to town this morning. Tell you the truth, I\u2019d like to\u2019ve been with you. And I\u2019d\u2019ve had sense enough to turn around, too.\u201dMiss Maudie puzzled me. With most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard a shambles, she still took a lively and cordial interest in Jem\u2019s and my affairs.She must have seen my perplexity. She said, \u201cOnly thing I worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused. This whole neighborhood could have gone up. Mr. Avery\u2019ll be in bed for a week\u2014he\u2019s right stove up. He\u2019s too old to do things like that and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean and when Stephanie Crawford\u2019s not looking, I\u2019ll make him a Lane cake. That Stephanie\u2019s been after my recipe for thirty years, and if she thinks I\u2019ll give it to her just because I\u2019m staying with her she\u2019s got another think coming.\u201dI reflected that if Miss Maudie broke down and gave it to her, Miss Stephanie couldn\u2019t follow it anyway. Miss Maudie had once let me see it: among other things, the recipe called for one large cup of sugar.It was a still day. The air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank, rattle and strain before it struck the hour. Miss Maudie\u2019s nose was a color I had never seen before, and I inquired about it.\u201cI\u2019ve been out here since six o\u2019clock,\u201d she said. \u201cShould be frozen by now.\u201d She held up her hands. A network of tiny lines criss-crossed her palms, brown with dirt and dried blood.\u201cYou\u2019ve ruined \u2019em,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a colored man?\u201d There was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added, \u201cOr Scout\u2019n\u2019me, we can help you.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Miss Maudie said, \u201cThank you sir, but you\u2019ve got a job of your own over there.\u201d She pointed to our yard.\u201cYou mean the Morphodite?\u201d I asked. \u201cShoot, we can rake him up in a jiffy.\u201dMiss Maudie stared down at me, her lips moving silently. Suddenly she put her hands to her head and whooped. When we left her, she was still chuckling.Jem said he didn\u2019t know what was the matter with her\u2014that was just Miss Maudie.9\u201cYou can just take that back, boy!\u201dThis order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a rather thin time for Jem and me. My fists were clenched and I was ready to let fly. Atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more; I was far too old and too big for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the better off everybody would be. I soon forgot.Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard the day before that Scout Finch\u2019s daddy defended niggers. I denied it, but told Jem.\u201cWhat\u2019d he mean sayin\u2019 that?\u201d I asked.\u201cNothing,\u201d Jem said. \u201cAsk Atticus, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cDo you defend niggers, Atticus?\u201d I asked him that evening.\u201cOf course I do. Don\u2019t say nigger, Scout. That\u2019s common.\u201d\u201c \u2019s what everybody at school says.\u201d\u201cFrom now on it\u2019ll be everybody less one\u2014\u201d\u201cWell if you don\u2019t want me to grow up talkin\u2019 that way, why do you send me to school?\u201dMy father looked at me mildly, amusement in his eyes. Despite our compromise, my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first day\u2019s dose of it: the beginning of last September had brought on sinking spells, dizziness, and mild gastric complaints. I went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of Miss Rachel\u2019s cook\u2019s son, who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm. It didn\u2019t take.But I was worrying another bone. \u201cDo all lawyers defend n-Negroes, Atticus?\u201d\u201cOf course they do, Scout.\u201d\u201cThen why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like you were runnin\u2019 a still.\u201dAtticus sighed. \u201cI\u2019m simply defending a Negro\u2014his name\u2019s Tom Robinson. He lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. He\u2019s a member of Calpurnia\u2019s church, and Cal knows his family well. She says they\u2019re clean-living folks. Scout, you aren\u2019t old enough to understand some things yet, but there\u2019s been some high talk around town to the effect that I shouldn\u2019t do much about defending this man. It\u2019s a peculiar case\u2014it won\u2019t come to trial until summer session. John Taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement . . .\u201d\u201cIf you shouldn\u2019t be defendin\u2019 him, then why are you doin\u2019 it?\u201d\u201cFor a number of reasons,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cThe main one is, if I didn\u2019t I couldn\u2019t hold up my head in town, I couldn\u2019t represent this county in the legislature, I couldn\u2019t even tell you or Jem not to do something again.\u201d\u201cYou mean if you didn\u2019t defend that man, Jem and me wouldn\u2019t have to mind you any more?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s about right.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the nature of the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally. This one\u2019s mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don\u2019t you let \u2019em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change . . . it\u2019s a good one, even if it does resist learning.\u201d\u201cAtticus, are we going to win it?\u201d\u201cNo, honey.\u201d\u201cThen, why\u2014\u201d\u201cSimply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win,\u201d Atticus said.\u201cYou sound like Cousin Ike Finch,\u201d I said. Cousin Ike Finch was Maycomb County\u2019s sole surviving Confederate veteran. He wore a General Hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain. At least once a year Atticus, Jem and I called on him, and I would have to kiss him. It was horrible. Jem and I would listen respectfully to Atticus and Cousin Ike rehash the war. \u201cTell you, Atticus,\u201d Cousin Ike would say, \u201cthe Missouri Compromise was what licked us, but if I had to go through it agin I\u2019d walk every step of the way there an\u2019 every step back jist like I did before an\u2019 furthermore we\u2019d whip \u2019em this time . . . now in 1864, when Stonewall Jackson came around by\u2014I beg your pardon, young folks. Ol\u2019 Blue Light was in heaven then, God rest his saintly brow. . . .\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cCome here, Scout,\u201d said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently. \u201cIt\u2019s different this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time we aren\u2019t fighting the Yankees, we\u2019re fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get, they\u2019re still our friends and this is still our home.\u201dWith this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day: \u201cYou gonna take that back, boy?\u201d\u201cYou gotta make me first!\u201d he yelled. \u201cMy folks said your daddy was a disgrace an\u2019 that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank!\u201dI drew a bead on him, remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped my fists and walked away, \u201cScout\u2019s a cow\u2014ward!\u201d ringing in my ears. It was the first time I ever walked away from a fight.Somehow, if I fought Cecil I would let Atticus down. Atticus so rarely asked Jem and me to do something for him, I could take being called a coward for him. I felt extremely noble for having remembered, and remained noble for three weeks. Then Christmas came and disaster struck.Jem and I viewed Christmas with mixed feelings. The good side was the tree and Uncle Jack Finch. Every Christmas Eve day we met Uncle Jack at Maycomb Junction, and he would spend a week with us.A flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of Aunt Alexandra and Francis.I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandra\u2019s husband, but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, \u201cGet off the fence,\u201d once, I never saw any reason to take notice of him. Neither did Aunt Alexandra. Long ago, in a burst of friendliness, Aunty and Uncle Jimmy produced a son named Henry, who left home as soon as was humanly possible, married, and produced Francis. Henry and his wife deposited Francis at his grandparents\u2019 every Christmas, then pursued their own pleasures.No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend Christmas day at home. We went to Finch\u2019s Landing every Christmas in my memory. The fact that Aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with Francis Hancock. He was a year older than I, and I avoided him on principle: he enjoyed everything I disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous diversions.Aunt Alexandra was Atticus\u2019s sister, but when Jem told me about changelings and siblings, I decided that she had been swapped at birth, that my grandparents had perhaps received a Crawford instead of a Finch. Had I ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandra would have been analogous to Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was cold and there.When Uncle Jack jumped down from the train Christmas Eve day, we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages. Jem and I always thought it funny when Uncle Jack pecked Atticus on the cheek; they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other. Uncle Jack shook hands with Jem and swung me high, but not high enough: Uncle Jack was a head shorter than Atticus; the baby of the family, he was younger than Aunt Alexandra. He and Aunty looked alike, but Uncle Jack made better use of his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin.He was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably because he never behaved like a doctor. Whenever he performed a minor service for Jem and me, as removing a splinter from a foot, he would tell us exactly what he was going to do, give us an estimation of how much it would hurt, and explain the use of any tongs he employed. One Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot, permitting no one to come near me. When Uncle Jack caught me, he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and delivering five-minute sermons to any passers-by who desired spiritual comfort. I interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me know when he would pull it out, but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while I was laughing, that was what was known as relativity.\u201cWhat\u2019s in those packages?\u201d I asked him, pointing to the long thin parcels the porter had given him.\u201cNone of your business,\u201d he said.Jem said, \u201cHow\u2019s Rose Aylmer?\u201dRose Aylmer was Uncle Jack\u2019s cat. She was a beautiful yellow female Uncle Jack said was one of the few women he could stand permanently. He reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshots. We admired them.\u201cShe\u2019s gettin\u2019 fat,\u201d I said.\u201cI should think so. She eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital.\u201d\u201cAw, that\u2019s a damn story,\u201d I said.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201dAtticus said, \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to her, Jack. She\u2019s trying you out. Cal says she\u2019s been cussing fluently for a week, now.\u201dUncle Jack raised his eyebrows and said nothing. I was proceeding on the dim theory, aside from the innate attractiveness of such words, that if Atticus discovered I had picked them up at school he wouldn\u2019t make me go.But at supper that evening when I asked him to pass the damn ham, please, Uncle Jack pointed at me. \u201cSee me afterwards, young lady,\u201d he said.When supper was over, Uncle Jack went to the livingroom and sat down. He slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap. I liked to smell him: he was like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet. He pushed back my bangs and looked at me. \u201cYou\u2019re more like Atticus than your mother,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re also growing out of your pants a little.\u201d\u201cI reckon they fit all right.\u201d\u201cYou like words like damn and hell now, don\u2019t you?\u201dI said I reckoned so.\u201cWell I don\u2019t,\u201d said Uncle Jack, \u201cnot unless there\u2019s extreme provocation connected with \u2019em. I\u2019ll be here a week, and I don\u2019t want to hear any words like that while I\u2019m here. Scout, you\u2019ll get in trouble if you go around saying things like that. You want to grow up to be a lady, don\u2019t you?\u201dI said not particularly.\u201cOf course you do. Now let\u2019s get to the tree.\u201dWe decorated the tree until bedtime, and that night I dreamed of the two long packages for Jem and me. Next morning Jem and I dived for them: they were from Atticus, who had written Uncle Jack to get them for us, and they were what we had asked for.\u201cDon\u2019t point them in the house,\u201d said Atticus, when Jem aimed at a picture on the wall.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to teach \u2019em to shoot,\u201d said Uncle Jack.\u201cThat\u2019s your job,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cI merely bowed to the inevitable.\u201dIt took Atticus\u2019s courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree. He declined to let us take our air rifles to the Landing (I had already begun to think of shooting Francis) and said if we made one false move he\u2019d take them away from us for good.Finch\u2019s Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps down a high bluff and ending in a jetty. Farther down stream, beyond the bluff, were traces of an old cotton landing, where Finch Negroes had loaded bales and produce, unloaded blocks of ice, flour and sugar, farm equipment, and feminine apparel. A two-rut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees. At the end of the road was a two-storied white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs. In his old age, our ancestor Simon Finch had built it to please his nagging wife; but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended. The internal arrangements of the Finch house were indicative of Simon\u2019s guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring.There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female children, one for Welcome Finch, the sole son, and one for visiting relatives. Simple enough; but the daughters\u2019 rooms could be reached only by one staircase, Welcome\u2019s room and the guestroom only by another. The Daughters\u2019 Staircase was in the ground-floor bedroom of their parents, so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters\u2019 nocturnal comings and goings.There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk; in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole, used to summon field hands or as a distress signal; a widow\u2019s walk was on the roof, but no widows walked there\u2014from it, Simon oversaw his overseer, watched the river-boats, and gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders.There went with the house the usual legend about the Yankees: one Finch female, recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the neighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the Daughters\u2019 Staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed through. When we arrived at the Landing, Aunt Alexandra kissed Uncle Jack, Francis kissed Uncle Jack, Uncle Jimmy shook hands silently with Uncle Jack, Jem and I gave our presents to Francis, who gave us a present. Jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to entertain our cousin. Francis was eight and slicked back his hair.\u201cWhat\u2019d you get for Christmas?\u201d I asked politely.\u201cJust what I asked for,\u201d he said. Francis had requested a pair of knee-pants, a red leather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow tie.\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I lied. \u201cJem and me got air-rifles, and Jem got a chemistry set\u2014\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cA toy one, I reckon.\u201d\u201cNo, a real one. He\u2019s gonna make me some invisible ink, and I\u2019m gonna write to Dill in it.\u201dFrancis asked what was the use of that.\u201cWell, can\u2019t you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it? It\u2019ll drive him nuts.\u201dTalking to Francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean. He was the most boring child I ever met. As he lived in Mobile, he could not inform on me to school authorities, but he managed to tell everything he knew to Aunt Alexandra, who in turn unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it or gave me hell, whichever struck his fancy. But the only time I ever heard Atticus speak sharply to anyone was when I once heard him say, \u201cSister, I do the best I can with them!\u201d It had something to do with my going around in overalls.Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandra\u2019s vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of sunshine in my father\u2019s lonely life. I suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well, but Aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam, that I was born good but had grown progressively worse every year. She hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge, but when I asked Atticus about it, he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business, he didn\u2019t mind me much the way I was.At Christmas dinner, I sat at the little table in the diningroom; Jem and Francis sat with the adults at the dining table. Aunty had continued to isolate me long after Jem and Francis graduated to the big table. I often wondered what she thought I\u2019d do, get up and throw something? I sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once, I would prove to her how civilized I could be; after all, I ate at home every day with no major mishaps. When I begged Atticus to use his influence, he said he had none\u2014we were guests, and we sat where she told us to sit. He also said Aunt Alexandra didn\u2019t understand girls much, she\u2019d never had one.But her cooking made up for everything: three kinds of meat, summer vegetables from her pantry shelves; peach pickles, two kinds of cake and ambrosia constituted a modest Christmas dinner. Afterwards, the adults made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition. Jem lay on the floor, and I went to the back yard. \u201cPut on your coat,\u201d said Atticus dreamily, so I didn\u2019t hear him.Francis sat beside me on the back steps. \u201cThat was the best yet,\u201d I said.\u201cGrandma\u2019s a wonderful cook,\u201d said Francis. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna teach me how.\u201d\u201cBoys don\u2019t cook.\u201d I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron.\u201cGrandma says all men should learn to cook, that men oughta be careful with their wives and wait on \u2019em when they don\u2019t feel good,\u201d said my cousin.\u201cI don\u2019t want Dill waitin\u2019 on me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d rather wait on him.\u201d\u201cDill?\u201d\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t say anything about it yet, but we\u2019re gonna get married as soon as we\u2019re big enough. He asked me last summer.\u201dFrancis hooted.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d I asked. \u201cAin\u2019t anything the matter with him.\u201d\u201cYou mean that little runt Grandma says stays with Miss Rachel every summer?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly who I mean.\u201d\u201cI know all about him,\u201d said Francis.\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u201cGrandma says he hasn\u2019t got a home\u2014\u201d\u201cHas too, he lives in Meridian.\u201d\u201c\u2014he just gets passed around from relative to relative, and Miss Rachel keeps him every summer.\u201d\u201cFrancis, that\u2019s not so!\u201dFrancis grinned at me. \u201cYou\u2019re mighty dumb sometimes, Jean Louise. Guess you don\u2019t know any better, though.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf Uncle Atticus lets you run around with stray dogs, that\u2019s his business, like Grandma says, so it ain\u2019t your fault. I guess it ain\u2019t your fault if Uncle Atticus is a nigger-lover besides, but I\u2019m here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family\u2014\u201d\u201cFrancis, what the hell do you mean?\u201d\u201cJust what I said. Grandma says it\u2019s bad enough he lets you all run wild, but now he\u2019s turned out a nigger-lover we\u2019ll never be able to walk the streets of Maycomb again. He\u2019s ruinin\u2019 the family, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doin\u2019.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen. At a safe distance he called, \u201cHe\u2019s nothin\u2019 but a nigger-lover!\u201d\u201cHe is not!\u201d I roared. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about, but you better cut it out this red hot minute!\u201dI leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk. It was easy to collar Francis. I said take it back quick.Francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen. \u201cNigger-lover!\u201d he yelled.When stalking one\u2019s prey, it is best to take one\u2019s time. Say nothing, and as sure as eggs he will become curious and emerge. Francis appeared at the kitchen door. \u201cYou still mad, Jean Louise?\u201d he asked tentatively.\u201cNothing to speak of,\u201d I said.Francis came out on the catwalk.\u201cYou gonna take it back, Fra\u2014ancis?\u201d But I was too quick on the draw. Francis shot back into the kitchen, so I retired to the steps. I could wait patiently. I had sat there perhaps five minutes when I heard Aunt Alexandra speak: \u201cWhere\u2019s Francis?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s out yonder in the kitchen.\u201d\u201cHe knows he\u2019s not supposed to play in there.\u201dFrancis came to the door and yelled, \u201cGrandma, she\u2019s got me in here and she won\u2019t let me out!\u201d\u201cWhat is all this, Jean Louise?\u201dI looked up at Aunt Alexandra. \u201cI haven\u2019t got him in there, Aunty, I ain\u2019t holdin\u2019 him.\u201d\u201cYes she is,\u201d shouted Francis, \u201cshe won\u2019t let me out!\u201d\u201cHave you all been fussing?\u201d\u201cJean Louise got mad at me, Grandma,\u201d called Francis.\u201cFrancis, come out of there! Jean Louise, if I hear another word out of you I\u2019ll tell your father. Did I hear you say hell a while ago?\u201d\u201cNome.\u201d\u201cI thought I did. I\u2019d better not hear it again.\u201dAunt Alexandra was a back-porch listener. The moment she was out of sight Francis came out head up and grinning. \u201cDon\u2019t you fool with me,\u201d he said.He jumped into the yard and kept his distance, kicking tufts of grass, turning around occasionally to smile at me. Jem appeared on the porch, looked at us, and went away. Francis climbed the mimosa tree, came down, put his hands in his pockets and strolled around the yard. \u201cHah!\u201d he said. I asked him who he thought he was, Uncle Jack? Francis said he reckoned I got told, for me to just sit there and leave him alone.\u201cI ain\u2019t botherin\u2019 you,\u201d I said.Francis looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been sufficiently subdued, and crooned softly, \u201cNigger-lover . . .\u201dThis time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left impaired, I sailed in with my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned my arms to my sides and said, \u201cStand still!\u201dAunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and Uncle Jimmy had come to the back porch when Francis started yelling.\u201cWho started this?\u201d said Uncle Jack.Francis and I pointed at each other. \u201cGrandma,\u201d he bawled, \u201cshe called me a whore-lady and jumped on me!\u201d\u201cIs that true, Scout?\u201d said Uncle Jack.\u201cI reckon so.\u201dWhen Uncle Jack looked down at me, his features were like Aunt Alexandra\u2019s. \u201cYou know I told you you\u2019d get in trouble if you used words like that? I told you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cYes sir, but\u2014\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re in trouble now. Stay there.\u201dI was debating whether to stand there or run, and tarried in indecision a moment too long: I turned to flee but Uncle Jack was quicker. I found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass.\u201cI\u2019ll never speak to you again as long as I live! I hate you an\u2019 despise you an\u2019 hope you die tomorrow!\u201d A statement that seemed to encourage Uncle Jack, more than anything. I ran to Atticus for comfort, but he said I had it coming and it was high time we went home. I climbed into the back seat of the car without saying good-bye to anyone, and at home I ran to my room and slammed the door. Jem tried to say something nice, but I wouldn\u2019t let him.When I surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks, and I was reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door. I asked who it was; Uncle Jack answered.\u201cGo away!\u201dUncle Jack said if I talked like that he\u2019d lick me again, so I was quiet. When he entered the room I retreated to a corner and turned my back on him. \u201cScout,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you still hate me?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cGo on, please sir.\u201d\u201cWhy, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d hold it against me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you\u2014you had that coming and you know it.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t either.\u201d\u201cHoney, you can\u2019t go around calling people\u2014\u201d\u201cYou ain\u2019t fair,\u201d I said, \u201cyou ain\u2019t fair.\u201dUncle Jack\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cNot fair? How not?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re real nice, Uncle Jack, an\u2019 I reckon I love you even after what you did, but you don\u2019t understand children much.\u201dUncle Jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me. \u201cAnd why do I not understand children, Miss Jean Louise? Such conduct as yours required little understanding. It was obstreperous, disorderly, and abusive\u2014\u201d\u201cYou gonna give me a chance to tell you? I don\u2019t mean to sass you, I\u2019m just tryin\u2019 to tell you.\u201dUncle Jack sat down on the bed. His eyebrows came together, and he peered up at me from under them. \u201cProceed,\u201d he said.I took a deep breath. \u201cWell, in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance to tell you my side of it\u2014you just lit right into me. When Jem an\u2019 I fuss Atticus doesn\u2019t ever just listen to Jem\u2019s side of it, he hears mine too, an\u2019 in the second place you told me never to use words like that except in extreme provocation, and Francis provocated me enough to knock his block off\u2014\u201dUncle Jack scratched his head. \u201cWhat was your side of it, Scout?\u201d\u201cFrancis called Atticus somethin\u2019, an\u2019 I wasn\u2019t about to take it off him.\u201d\u201cWhat did Francis call him?\u201d\u201cA nigger-lover. I ain\u2019t very sure what it means, but the way Francis said it\u2014tell you one thing right now, Uncle Jack, I\u2019ll be\u2014I swear before God if I\u2019ll sit there and let him say somethin\u2019 about Atticus.\u201d\u201cHe called Atticus that?\u201d\u201cYes sir, he did, an\u2019 a lot more. Said Atticus\u2019d be the ruination of the family an\u2019 he let Jem an\u2019 me run wild. . . .\u201dFrom the look on Uncle Jack\u2019s face, I thought I was in for it again. When he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see about this,\u201d I knew Francis was in for it. \u201cI\u2019ve a good mind to go out there tonight.\u201d\u201cPlease sir, just let it go. Please.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve no intention of letting it go,\u201d he said. \u201cAlexandra should know about this. The idea of\u2014wait\u2019ll I get my hands on that boy. . . .\u201d\u201cUncle Jack, please promise me somethin\u2019, please sir. Promise you won\u2019t tell Atticus about this. He\u2014he asked me one time not to let anything I heard about him make me mad, an\u2019 I\u2019d ruther him think we were fightin\u2019 about somethin\u2019 else instead. Please promise . . .\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t like Francis getting away with something like that\u2014\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t. You reckon you could tie up my hand? It\u2019s still bleedin\u2019 some.\u201d\u201cOf course I will, baby. I know of no hand I would be more delighted to tie up. Will you come this way?\u201dUncle Jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom. While he cleaned and bandaged my knuckles, he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named Hodge, and who counted all the cracks in the sidewalk when he went to town. \u201cThere now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a very unladylike scar on your wedding-ring finger.\u201d\u201cThank you sir. Uncle Jack?\u201d\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a whore-lady?\u201dUncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister who sat in the House of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there when all about him men were losing their heads. I guess he was trying to answer my question, but he made no sense whatsoever.Later, when I was supposed to be in bed, I went down the hall for a drink of water and heard Atticus and Uncle Jack in the livingroom:\u201cI shall never marry, Atticus.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI might have children.\u201dAtticus said, \u201cYou\u2019ve a lot to learn, Jack.\u201d\u201cI know. Your daughter gave me my first lesson this afternoon. She said I didn\u2019t understand children much and told me why. She was quite right. Atticus, she told me how I should have treated her\u2014oh dear, I\u2019m so sorry I romped on her.\u201dAtticus chuckled. \u201cShe earned it, so don\u2019t feel too remorseful.\u201dI waited, on tenterhooks, for Uncle Jack to tell Atticus my side of it. But he didn\u2019t. He simply murmured, \u201cHer use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to the imagination. But she doesn\u2019t know the meaning of half she says\u2014she asked me what a whore-lady was . . .\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cDid you tell her?\u201d\u201cNo, I told her about Lord Melbourne.\u201d\u201cJack! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness\u2019 sake. But don\u2019t make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults, and evasion simply muddles \u2019em. No,\u201d my father mused, \u201cyou had the right answer this afternoon, but the wrong reasons. Bad language is a stage all children go through, and it dies with time when they learn they\u2019re not attracting attention with it. Hotheadedness isn\u2019t. Scout\u2019s got to learn to keep her head and learn soon, with what\u2019s in store for her these next few months. She\u2019s coming along, though. Jem\u2019s getting older and she follows his example a good bit now. All she needs is assistance sometimes.\u201d\u201cAtticus, you\u2019ve never laid a hand on her.\u201d\u201cI admit that. So far I\u2019ve been able to get by with threats. Jack, she minds me as well as she can. Doesn\u2019t come up to scratch half the time, but she tries.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the answer,\u201d said Uncle Jack.\u201cNo, the answer is she knows I know she tries. That\u2019s what makes the difference. What bothers me is that she and Jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty soon. I\u2019m not worried about Jem keeping his head, but Scout\u2019d just as soon jump on someone as look at him if her pride\u2019s at stake. . . .\u201dI waited for Uncle Jack to break his promise. He still didn\u2019t.\u201cAtticus, how bad is this going to be? You haven\u2019t had too much chance to discuss it.\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be worse, Jack. The only thing we\u2019ve got is a black man\u2019s word against the Ewells\u2019. The evidence boils down to you-did\u2014I-didn\u2019t. The jury couldn\u2019t possibly be expected to take Tom Robinson\u2019s word against the Ewells\u2019\u2014are you acquainted with the Ewells?\u201dUncle Jack said yes, he remembered them. He described them to Atticus, but Atticus said, \u201cYou\u2019re a generation off. The present ones are the same, though.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do, then?\u201d\u201cBefore I\u2019m through, I intend to jar the jury a bit\u2014I think we\u2019ll have a reasonable chance on appeal, though. I really can\u2019t tell at this stage, Jack. You know, I\u2019d hoped to get through life without a case of this kind, but John Taylor pointed at me and said, \u2018You\u2019re It.\u2019 \u201d\u201cLet this cup pass from you, eh?\u201d\u201cRight. But do you think I could face my children otherwise? You know what\u2019s going to happen as well as I do, Jack, and I hope and pray I can get Jem and Scout through it without bitterness, and most of all, without catching Maycomb\u2019s usual disease. Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up, is something I don\u2019t pretend to understand . . . I just hope that Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town. I hope they trust me enough. . . . Jean Louise?\u201dMy scalp jumped. I stuck my head around the corner. \u201cSir?\u201d\u201cGo to bed.\u201dI scurried to my room and went to bed. Uncle Jack was a prince of a fellow not to let me down. But I never figured out how Atticus knew I was listening, and it was not until many years later that I realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.10Atticus was feeble: he was nearly fifty. When Jem and I asked him why he was so old, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness. He was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries, and there was nothing Jem or I could say about him when our classmates said, \u201cMy father\u2014\u201dJem was football crazy. Atticus was never too tired to play keep-away, but when Jem wanted to tackle him Atticus would say, \u201cI\u2019m too old for that, son.\u201dOur father didn\u2019t do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus did not drive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone.Besides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left eyes were the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something well, he turned his head and looked from his right eye.He did not do the things our schoolmates\u2019 fathers did: he never went hunting, he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the livingroom and read.With these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wished him to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom Robinson, none of which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs when I committed myself to a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout Finch wouldn\u2019t fight any more, her daddy wouldn\u2019t let her. This was not entirely correct: I wouldn\u2019t fight publicly for Atticus, but the family was private ground. I would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail. Francis Hancock, for example, knew that.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldn\u2019t teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasn\u2019t interested in guns. Atticus said to Jem one day, \u201cI\u2019d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you\u2019ll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit \u2019em, but remember it\u2019s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\u201dThat was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.\u201cYour father\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cMockingbirds don\u2019t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don\u2019t eat up people\u2019s gardens, don\u2019t nest in corncribs, they don\u2019t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\u201d\u201cMiss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cBeen here longer than the town.\u201d\u201cNome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me\u2019s the only children around here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel\u2019s old and so are you and Atticus.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t call fifty very old,\u201d said Miss Maudie tartly. \u201cNot being wheeled around yet, am I? Neither\u2019s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to burn down that old mausoleum of mine, I\u2019m too old to keep it up\u2014maybe you\u2019re right, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You\u2019ve never been around young folks much, have you?\u201d\u201cYessum, at school.\u201d\u201cI mean young grown-ups. You\u2019re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the benefit of your father\u2019s age. If your father was thirty you\u2019d find life quite different.\u201d\u201cI sure would. Atticus can\u2019t do anything. . . .\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cThere\u2019s life in him yet.\u201d\u201cWhat can he do?\u201d\u201cWell, he can make somebody\u2019s will so airtight can\u2019t anybody meddle with it.\u201d\u201cShoot . . .\u201d\u201cWell, did you know he\u2019s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the Landing when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both sides of the river.\u201d\u201cGood Lord, Miss Maudie, Jem and me beat him all the time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about time you found out it\u2019s because he lets you. Did you know he can play a Jew\u2019s Harp?\u201dThis modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him.\u201cWell . . .\u201d she said.\u201cWell what, Miss Maudie?\u201d\u201cWell nothing. Nothing\u2014it seems with all that you\u2019d be proud of him. Can\u2019t everybody play a Jew\u2019s Harp. Now keep out of the way of the carpenters. You\u2019d better go home, I\u2019ll be in my azaleas and can\u2019t watch you. Plank might hit you.\u201dI went to the back yard and found Jem plugging away at a tin can, which seemed stupid with all the bluejays around. I returned to the front yard and busied myself for two hours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch, consisting of a tire, an orange crate, the laundry hamper, the porch chairs, and a small U.S. flag Jem gave me from a popcorn box.When Atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across the street. \u201cWhat are you shooting at?\u201d\u201cMiss Maudie\u2019s rear end.\u201dAtticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes. He pushed his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street. \u201cMaudie,\u201d he called, \u201cI thought I\u2019d better warn you. You\u2019re in considerable peril.\u201dMiss Maudie straightened up and looked toward me. She said, \u201cAtticus, you are a devil from hell.\u201dWhen Atticus returned he told me to break camp. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever let me catch you pointing that gun at anybody again,\u201d he said.I wished my father was a devil from hell. I sounded out Calpurnia on the subject. \u201cMr. Finch? Why, he can do lots of things.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d I asked.Calpurnia scratched her head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t rightly know,\u201d she said.Jem underlined it when he asked Atticus if he was going out for the Methodists and Atticus said he\u2019d break his neck if he did, he was just too old for that sort of thing. The Methodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage, and had challenged the Baptists to a game of touch football. Everybody in town\u2019s father was playing, it seemed, except Atticus. Jem said he didn\u2019t even want to go, but he was unable to resist football in any form, and he stood gloomily on the sidelines with Atticus and me watching Cecil Jacob\u2019s father make touchdowns for the Baptists.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "One Saturday Jem and I decided to go exploring with our air-rifles to see if we could find a rabbit or a squirrel. We had gone about five hundred yards beyond the Radley Place when I noticed Jem squinting at something down the street. He had turned his head to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes.\u201cWhatcha looking at?\u201d\u201cThat old dog down yonder,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s old Tim Johnson, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dTim Johnson was the property of Mr. Harry Johnson who drove the Mobile bus and lived on the southern edge of town. Tim was a liver-colored bird dog, the pet of Maycomb.\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, Scout. We better go home.\u201d\u201cAw Jem, it\u2019s February.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m gonna tell Cal.\u201dWe raced home and ran to the kitchen.\u201cCal,\u201d said Jem, \u201ccan you come down the sidewalk a minute?\u201d\u201cWhat for, Jem? I can\u2019t come down the sidewalk every time you want me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s somethin\u2019 wrong with an old dog down yonder.\u201dCalpurnia sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t wrap up any dog\u2019s foot now. There\u2019s some gauze in the bathroom, go get it and do it yourself.\u201dJem shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s sick, Cal. Something\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s he doin\u2019, trying to catch his tail?\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s doin\u2019 like this.\u201dJem gulped like a goldfish, hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso. \u201cHe\u2019s goin\u2019 like that, only not like he means to.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me a story, Jem Finch?\u201d Calpurnia\u2019s voice hardened.\u201cNo Cal, I swear I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cWas he runnin\u2019?\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s just moseyin\u2019 along, so slow you can\u2019t hardly tell it. He\u2019s comin\u2019 this way.\u201dCalpurnia rinsed her hands and followed Jem into the yard. \u201cI don\u2019t see any dog,\u201d she said.She followed us beyond the Radley Place and looked where Jem pointed. Tim Johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance, but he was closer to us. He walked erratically, as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs. He reminded me of a car stuck in a sand-bed.\u201cHe\u2019s gone lopsided,\u201d said Jem.Calpurnia stared, then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home. She shut the wood door behind us, went to the telephone and shouted, \u201cGimme Mr. Finch\u2019s office!\u201d\u201cMr. Finch!\u201d she shouted. \u201cThis is Cal. I swear to God there\u2019s a mad dog down the street a piece\u2014he\u2019s comin\u2019 this way, yes sir, he\u2019s\u2014Mr. Finch, I declare he is\u2014old Tim Johnson, yes sir . . . yessir . . . yes\u2014\u201dShe hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what Atticus had said. She rattled the telephone hook and said, \u201cMiss Eula May\u2014now ma\u2019am, I\u2019m through talkin\u2019 to Mr. Finch, please don\u2019t connect me no more\u2014listen, Miss Eula May, can you call Miss Rachel and Miss Stephanie Crawford and whoever\u2019s got a phone on this street and tell \u2019em a mad dog\u2019s comin\u2019? Please ma\u2019am!\u201dCalpurnia listened. \u201cI know it\u2019s February, Miss Eula May, but I know a mad dog when I see one. Please ma\u2019am hurry!\u201dCalpurnia asked Jem, \u201cRadleys got a phone?\u201dJem looked in the book and said no. \u201cThey won\u2019t come out anyway, Cal.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care, I\u2019m gonna tell \u2019em.\u201dShe ran to the front porch, Jem and I at her heels. \u201cYou stay in that house!\u201d she yelled.Calpurnia\u2019s message had been received by the neighborhood. Every wood door within our range of vision was closed tight. We saw no trace of Tim Johnson. We watched Calpurnia running toward the Radley Place, holding her skirt and apron above her knees. She went up to the front steps and banged on the door. She got no answer, and she shouted, \u201cMr. Nathan, Mr. Arthur, mad dog\u2019s comin\u2019! Mad dog\u2019s comin\u2019!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to go around in back,\u201d I said.Jem shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t make any difference now,\u201d he said.Calpurnia pounded on the door in vain. No one acknowledged her warning; no one seemed to have heard it.As Calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black Ford swung into the driveway. Atticus and Mr. Heck Tate got out.Mr. Heck Tate was the sheriff of Maycomb County. He was as tall as Atticus, but thinner. He was long-nosed, wore boots with shiny metal eye-holes, boot pants and a lumber jacket. His belt had a row of bullets sticking in it. He carried a heavy rifle. When he and Atticus reached the porch, Jem opened the door.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cStay inside, son,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cWhere is he, Cal?\u201d\u201cHe oughta be here by now,\u201d said Calpurnia, pointing down the street.\u201cNot runnin\u2019, is he?\u201d asked Mr. Tate.\u201cNaw sir, he\u2019s in the twitchin\u2019 stage, Mr. Heck.\u201d\u201cShould we go after him, Heck?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cWe better wait, Mr. Finch. They usually go in a straight line, but you never can tell. He might follow the curve\u2014hope he does or he\u2019ll go straight in the Radley back yard. Let\u2019s wait a minute.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think he\u2019ll get in the Radley yard,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cFence\u2019ll stop him. He\u2019ll probably follow the road. . . .\u201dI thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and lunged at throats, and I thought they did it in August. Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have been less frightened.Nothing is more deadly than a deserted, waiting street. The trees were still, the mockingbirds were silent, the carpenters at Miss Maudie\u2019s house had vanished. I heard Mr. Tate sniff, then blow his nose. I saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm. I saw Miss Stephanie Crawford\u2019s face framed in the glass window of her front door. Miss Maudie appeared and stood beside her. Atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh.\u201cThere he is,\u201d he said softly.Tim Johnson came into sight, walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel to the Radley house.\u201cLook at him,\u201d whispered Jem. \u201cMr. Heck said they walked in a straight line. He can\u2019t even stay in the road.\u201d\u201cHe looks more sick than anything,\u201d I said.\u201cLet anything get in front of him and he\u2019ll come straight at it.\u201dMr. Tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward. \u201cHe\u2019s got it all right, Mr. Finch.\u201dTim Johnson was advancing at a snail\u2019s pace, but he was not playing or sniffing at foliage: he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that was inching him toward us. We could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies; his jaw opened and shut; he was alist, but he was being pulled gradually toward us.\u201cHe\u2019s lookin\u2019 for a place to die,\u201d said Jem.Mr. Tate turned around. \u201cHe\u2019s far from dead, Jem, he hasn\u2019t got started yet.\u201dTim Johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the Radley Place, and what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he would take. He made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the Radley gate; then he tried to turn around, but was having difficulty.Atticus said, \u201cHe\u2019s within range, Heck. You better get him now before he goes down the side street\u2014Lord knows who\u2019s around the corner. Go inside, Cal.\u201dCalpurnia opened the screen door, latched it behind her, then unlatched it and held onto the hook. She tried to block Jem and me with her body, but we looked out from beneath her arms.\u201cTake him, Mr. Finch.\u201d Mr. Tate handed the rifle to Atticus; Jem and I nearly fainted.\u201cDon\u2019t waste time, Heck,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cMr. Finch, this is one-shot job.\u201dAtticus shook his head vehemently: \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, Heck! He won\u2019t wait all day for you\u2014\u201d\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Mr. Finch, look where he is! Miss and you\u2019ll go straight into the Radley house! I can\u2019t shoot that well and you know it!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t shot a gun in thirty years\u2014\u201dMr. Tate almost threw the rifle at Atticus. \u201cI\u2019d feel mighty comfortable if you did now,\u201d he said.In a fog, Jem and I watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of the street. He walked quickly, but I thought he moved like an underwater swimmer: time had slowed to a nauseating crawl.When Atticus raised his glasses Calpurnia murmured, \u201cSweet Jesus help him,\u201d and put her hands to her cheeks.Atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead; they slipped down, and he dropped them in the street. In the silence, I heard them crack. Atticus rubbed his eyes and chin; we saw him blink hard.In front of the Radley gate, Tim Johnson had made up what was left of his mind. He had finally turned himself around, to pursue his original course up our street. He made two steps forward, then stopped and raised his head. We saw his body go rigid.With movements so swift they seemed simultaneous, Atticus\u2019s hand yanked a ball-tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder.The rifle cracked. Tim Johnson leaped, flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk in a brown-and-white heap. He didn\u2019t know what hit him.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Mr. Tate jumped off the porch and ran to the Radley Place. He stopped in front of the dog, squatted, turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye. \u201cYou were a little to the right, Mr. Finch,\u201d he called.\u201cAlways was,\u201d answered Atticus. \u201cIf I had my \u2019druthers I\u2019d take a shotgun.\u201dHe stooped and picked up his glasses, ground the broken lenses to powder under his heel, and went to Mr. Tate and stood looking down at Tim Johnson.Doors opened one by one, and the neighborhood slowly came alive. Miss Maudie walked down the steps with Miss Stephanie Crawford.Jem was paralyzed. I pinched him to get him moving, but when Atticus saw us coming he called, \u201cStay where you are.\u201dWhen Mr. Tate and Atticus returned to the yard, Mr. Tate was smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll have Zeebo collect him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgot much, Mr. Finch. They say it never leaves you.\u201dAtticus was silent.\u201cAtticus?\u201d said Jem.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d\u201cI saw that, One-Shot Finch!\u201dAtticus wheeled and faced Miss Maudie. They looked at one another without saying anything, and Atticus got into the sheriff\u2019s car. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said to Jem. \u201cDon\u2019t you go near that dog, you understand? Don\u2019t go near him, he\u2019s just as dangerous dead as alive.\u201d\u201cYes sir,\u201d said Jem. \u201cAtticus\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat, son?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, boy, can\u2019t you talk?\u201d said Mr. Tate, grinning at Jem. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know your daddy\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cHush, Heck,\u201d said Atticus, \u201clet\u2019s go back to town.\u201dWhen they drove away, Jem and I went to Miss Stephanie\u2019s front steps. We sat waiting for Zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck.Jem sat in numb confusion, and Miss Stephanie said, \u201cUh, uh, uh, who\u2019da thought of a mad dog in February? Maybe he wasn\u2019t mad, maybe he was just crazy. I\u2019d hate to see Harry Johnson\u2019s face when he gets in from the Mobile run and finds Atticus Finch\u2019s shot his dog. But he was just full of fleas from somewhere\u2014\u201dMiss Maudie said Miss Stephanie\u2019d be singing a different tune if Tim Johnson was still coming up the street, that they\u2019d find out soon enough, they\u2019d send his head to Montgomery.Jem became vaguely articulate: \u201c\u2019d you see him, Scout? \u2019d you see him just standin\u2019 there? . . . \u2019n\u2019 all of a sudden he just relaxed all over, an\u2019 it looked like that gun was a part of him . . . an\u2019 he did it so quick, like . . . I hafta aim for ten minutes \u2019fore I can hit somethin\u2019. . . .\u201dMiss Maudie grinned wickedly. \u201cWell now, Miss Jean Louise,\u201d she said, \u201cstill think your father can\u2019t do anything? Still ashamed of him?\u201d\u201cNome,\u201d I said meekly.\u201cForgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the Jew\u2019s Harp, Atticus Finch was the deadest shot in Maycomb County in his time.\u201d\u201cDead shot . . .\u201d echoed Jem.\u201cThat what I said, Jem Finch. Guess you\u2019ll change your tune now. The very idea, didn\u2019t you know his nickname was Ol\u2019 One-Shot when he was a boy? Why, down at the Landing when he was coming up, if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves he\u2019d complain about wasting ammunition.\u201d\u201cHe never said anything about that,\u201d Jem muttered.\u201cNever said anything about it, did he?\u201d\u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cWonder why he never goes huntin\u2019 now,\u201d I said.\u201cMaybe I can tell you,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cIf your father\u2019s anything, he\u2019s civilized in his heart. Marksmanship\u2019s a gift of God, a talent\u2014oh, you have to practice to make it perfect, but shootin\u2019s different from playing the piano or the like. I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him an unfair advantage over most living things. I guess he decided he wouldn\u2019t shoot till he had to, and he had to today.\u201d\u201cLooks like he\u2019d be proud of it,\u201d I said.\u201cPeople in their right minds never take pride in their talents,\u201d said Miss Maudie.We saw Zeebo drive up. He took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck and gingerly lifted Tim Johnson. He pitched the dog onto the truck, then poured something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where Tim fell. \u201cDon\u2019t yawl come over here for a while,\u201d he called.When we went home I told Jem we\u2019d really have something to talk about at school on Monday. Jem turned on me.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t say anything about it, Scout,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat? I certainly am. Ain\u2019t everybody\u2019s daddy the deadest shot in Maycomb County.\u201dJem said, \u201cI reckon if he\u2019d wanted us to know it, he\u2019da told us. If he was proud of it, he\u2019da told us.\u201d\u201cMaybe it just slipped his mind,\u201d I said.\u201cNaw, Scout, it\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t understand. Atticus is real old, but I wouldn\u2019t care if he couldn\u2019t do anything\u2014I wouldn\u2019t care if he couldn\u2019t do a blessed thing.\u201dJem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse. Running after it, he called back: \u201cAtticus is a gentleman, just like me!\u201d11When we were small, Jem and I confined our activities to the southern neighborhood, but when I was well into the second grade at school and tormenting Boo Radley became pass\u00e9, the business section of Maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the real property of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. It was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way. Previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more, but Jem said I had to grow up some time.Mrs. Dubose lived alone except for a Negro girl in constant attendance, two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dog-trot hall. She was very old; she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. It was rumored that she kept a CSA pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps.Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would be raked by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior, and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up, which was always nothing. We had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street; that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it.We could do nothing to please her. If I said as sunnily as I could, \u201cHey, Mrs. Dubose,\u201d I would receive for an answer, \u201cDon\u2019t you say hey to me, you ugly girl! You say good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose!\u201dShe was vicious. Once she heard Jem refer to our father as \u201cAtticus\u201d and her reaction was apoplectic. Besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way, we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mother\u2019s death. A lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it was heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild. I did not remember our mother, but Jem did\u2014he would tell me about her sometimes\u2014and he went livid when Mrs. Dubose shot us this message.Jem, having survived Boo Radley, a mad dog and other terrors, and concluded that it was cowardly to stop at Miss Rachel\u2019s front steps and wait, and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet Atticus coming from work. Countless evenings Atticus would find Jem furious at something Mrs. Dubose had said when we went by.\u201cEasy does it, son,\u201d Atticus would say. \u201cShe\u2019s an old lady and she\u2019s ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, it\u2019s your job not to let her make you mad.\u201dJem would say she must not be very sick, she hollered so. When the three of us came to her house, Atticus would sweep off his hat, wave gallantly to her and say, \u201cGood evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a picture this evening.\u201dI never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell her the courthouse news, and would say he hoped with all his heart she\u2019d have a good day tomorrow. He would return his hat to his head, swing me to his shoulders in her very presence, and we would go home in the twilight. It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.The day after Jem\u2019s twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets, so we headed for town in the early afternoon. Jem thought he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me.I had long had my eye on that baton; it was at V. J. Elmore\u2019s, it was bedecked with sequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. It was then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the Maycomb County High School band. Having developed my talent to where I could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down, I had caused Calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand. I felt that I could overcome this defect with a real baton, and I thought it generous of Jem to buy one for me.Mrs. Dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWhere are you two going at this time of day?\u201d she shouted. \u201cPlaying hooky, I suppose. I\u2019ll just call up the principal and tell him!\u201d She put her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face.\u201cAw, it\u2019s Saturday, Mrs. Dubose,\u201d said Jem.\u201cMakes no difference if it\u2019s Saturday,\u201d she said obscurely. \u201cI wonder if your father knows where you are?\u201d\u201cMrs. Dubose, we\u2019ve been goin\u2019 to town by ourselves since we were this high.\u201d Jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk.\u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me!\u201d she yelled. \u201cJeremy Finch, Maudie Atkinson told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning. She\u2019s going to tell your father and then you\u2019ll wish you never saw the light of day! If you aren\u2019t sent to the reform school before next week, my name\u2019s not Dubose!\u201dJem, who hadn\u2019t been near Miss Maudie\u2019s scuppernong arbor since last summer, and who knew Miss Maudie wouldn\u2019t tell Atticus if he had, issued a general denial.\u201cDon\u2019t you contradict me!\u201d Mrs. Dubose bawled. \u201cAnd you\u2014\u201d she pointed an arthritic finger at me\u2014\u201cwhat are you doing in those overalls? You should be in a dress and camisole, young lady! You\u2019ll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesn\u2019t change your ways\u2014a Finch waiting on tables at the O.K. Caf\u00e9\u2014hah!\u201dI was terrified. The O.K. Caf\u00e9 was a dim organization on the north side of the square. I grabbed Jem\u2019s hand but he shook me loose.\u201cCome on, Scout,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to her, just hold your head high and be a gentleman.\u201dBut Mrs. Dubose held us: \u201cNot only a Finch waiting on tables but one in the courthouse lawing for niggers!\u201dJem stiffened. Mrs. Dubose\u2019s shot had gone home and she knew it:\u201cYes indeed, what has this world come to when a Finch goes against his raising? I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d She put her hand to her mouth. When she drew it away, it trailed a long silver thread of saliva. \u201cYour father\u2019s no better than the niggers and trash he works for!\u201dJem was scarlet. I pulled at his sleeve, and we were followed up the sidewalk by a philippic on our family\u2019s moral degeneration, the major premise of which was that half the Finches were in the asylum anyway, but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a state.I wasn\u2019t sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs. Dubose\u2019s assessment of the family\u2019s mental hygiene. I had become almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was the first one coming from an adult. Except for her remarks about Atticus, Mrs. Dubose\u2019s attack was only routine. There was a hint of summer in the air\u2014in the shadows it was cool, but the sun was warm, which meant good times coming: no school and Dill.Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmore\u2019s for my baton. Jem took no pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home. On the way home I nearly hit Mr. Link Deas, who said, \u201cLook out now, Scout!\u201d when I missed a toss, and when we approached Mrs. Dubose\u2019s house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.She was not on the porch.In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made him break the bonds of \u201cYou just be a gentleman, son,\u201d and the phase of self-conscious rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his temper\u2014he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time, however, I thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad.What Jem did was something I\u2019d do as a matter of course had I not been under Atticus\u2019s interdict, which I assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies. We had just come to her gate when Jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into Mrs. Dubose\u2019s front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said, forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs. Dubose missed, her girl Jessie probably wouldn\u2019t.He did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush Mrs. Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves. He bent my baton against his knee, snapped it in two and threw it down.By that time I was shrieking. Jem yanked my hair, said he didn\u2019t care, he\u2019d do it again if he got a chance, and if I didn\u2019t shut up he\u2019d pull every hair out of my head. I didn\u2019t shut up and he kicked me. I lost my balance and fell on my face. Jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry. There was nothing to say.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "We did not choose to meet Atticus coming home that evening. We skulked around the kitchen until Calpurnia threw us out. By some voo-doo system Calpurnia seemed to know all about it. She was a less than satisfactory source of palliation, but she did give Jem a hot biscuit-and-butter which he tore in half and shared with me. It tasted like cotton.We went to the livingroom. I picked up a football magazine, found a picture of Dixie Howell, showed it to Jem and said, \u201cThis looks like you.\u201d That was the nicest thing I could think to say to him, but it was no help. He sat by the windows, hunched down in a rocking chair, scowling, waiting. Daylight faded.Two geological ages later, we heard the soles of Atticus\u2019s shoes scrape the front steps. The screen door slammed, there was a pause\u2014Atticus was at the hat rack in the hall\u2014and we heard him call, \u201cJem!\u201d His voice was like the winter wind.Atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us there, frozen still. He carried my baton in one hand; its filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug. He held out his other hand; it contained fat camellia buds.\u201cJem,\u201d he said, \u201care you responsible for this?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201dJem said softly, \u201cShe said you lawed for niggers and trash.\u201d\u201cYou did this because she said that?\u201dJem\u2019s lips moved, but his \u201cYes sir\u201d was inaudible.\u201cSon, I have no doubt that you\u2019ve been annoyed by your contemporaries about me lawing for niggers, as you say, but to do something like this to a sick old lady is inexcusable. I strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with Mrs. Dubose,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cCome straight home afterward.\u201dJem did not move.\u201cGo on, I said.\u201dI followed Jem out of the livingroom. \u201cCome back here,\u201d Atticus said to me. I came back.Atticus picked up The Mobile Press and sat down in the rocking chair Jem had vacated. For the life of me, I did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a Confederate Army relic. Of course Jem antagonized me sometimes until I could kill him, but when it came down to it he was all I had. Atticus did not seem to realize this, or if he did he didn\u2019t care.I hated him for that, but when you are in trouble you become easily tired: soon I was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me.\u201cYou\u2019re mighty big to be rocked,\u201d he said.\u201cYou don\u2019t care what happens to him,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just send him on to get shot at when all he was doin\u2019 was standin\u2019 up for you.\u201dAtticus pushed my head under his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to worry yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought Jem\u2019d be the one to lose his head over this\u2014thought I\u2019d have more trouble with you.\u201dI said I didn\u2019t see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody I knew at school had to keep his head about anything.\u201cScout,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cwhen summer comes you\u2019ll have to keep your head about far worse things . . . it\u2019s not fair for you and Jem, I know that, but sometimes we have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down\u2014well, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe you\u2019ll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didn\u2019t let you down. This case, Tom Robinson\u2019s case, is something that goes to the essence of a man\u2019s conscience\u2014Scout, I couldn\u2019t go to church and worship God if I didn\u2019t try to help that man.\u201d\u201cAtticus, you must be wrong. . . .\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWell, most folks seem to think they\u2019re right and you\u2019re wrong. . . .\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re certainly entitled to think that, and they\u2019re entitled to full respect for their opinions,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cbut before I can live with other folks I\u2019ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn\u2019t abide by majority rule is a person\u2019s conscience.\u201dWhen Jem returned, he found me still in Atticus\u2019s lap. \u201cWell, son?\u201d said Atticus. He set me on my feet, and I made a secret reconnaissance of Jem. He seemed to be all in one piece, but he had a queer look on his face. Perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel.\u201cI cleaned it up for her and said I was sorry, but I ain\u2019t, and that I\u2019d work on \u2019em ever Saturday and try to make \u2019em grow back out.\u201d\u201cThere was no point in saying you were sorry if you aren\u2019t,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cJem, she\u2019s old and ill. You can\u2019t hold her responsible for what she says and does. Of course, I\u2019d rather she\u2019d have said it to me than to either of you, but we can\u2019t always have our \u2019druthers.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet. \u201cAtticus,\u201d he said, \u201cshe wants me to read to her.\u201d\u201cRead to her?\u201d\u201cYes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and Saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours. Atticus, do I have to?\u201d\u201cCertainly.\u201d\u201cBut she wants me to do it for a month.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll do it for a month.\u201dJem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in. Finally he said, \u201cAtticus, it\u2019s all right on the sidewalk but inside it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s all dark and creepy. There\u2019s shadows and things on the ceiling. . . .\u201dAtticus smiled grimly. \u201cThat should appeal to your imagination. Just pretend you\u2019re inside the Radley house.\u201dThe following Monday afternoon Jem and I climbed the steep front steps to Mrs. Dubose\u2019s house and padded down the open hallway. Jem, armed with Ivanhoe and full of superior knowledge, knocked at the second door on the left.\u201cMrs. Dubose?\u201d he called.Jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door.\u201cIs that you, Jem Finch?\u201d she said. \u201cYou got your sister with you. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d\u201cLet \u2019em both in, Jessie,\u201d said Mrs. Dubose. Jessie admitted us and went off to the kitchen.An oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold, an odor I had met many times in rain-rotted gray houses where there are coal-oil lamps, water dippers, and unbleached domestic sheets. It always made me afraid, expectant, watchful.In the corner of the room was a brass bed, and in the bed was Mrs. Dubose. I wondered if Jem\u2019s activities had put her there, and for a moment I felt sorry for her. She was lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly.There was a marble-topped washstand by her bed; on it were a glass with a teaspoon in it, a red ear syringe, a box of absorbent cotton, and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs.\u201cSo you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you?\u201d was her greeting.Jem said quietly, \u201cMy sister ain\u2019t dirty and I ain\u2019t scared of you,\u201d although I noticed his knees shaking.I was expecting a tirade, but all she said was, \u201cYou may commence reading, Jeremy.\u201dJem sat down in a cane-bottom chair and opened Ivanhoe. I pulled up another one and sat beside him.\u201cCome closer,\u201d said Mrs. Dubose. \u201cCome to the side of the bed.\u201dWe moved our chairs forward. This was the nearest I had ever been to her, and the thing I wanted most to do was move my chair back again.She was horrible. Her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase, and the corners of her mouth glistened with wet, which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves enclosing her chin. Old-age liver spots dotted her cheeks, and her pale eyes had black pinpoint pupils. Her hands were knobby, and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails. Her bottom plate was not in, and her upper lip protruded; from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it. This made the wet move faster.I didn\u2019t look any more than I had to. Jem reopened Ivanhoe and began reading. I tried to keep up with him, but he read too fast. When Jem came to a word he didn\u2019t know, he skipped it, but Mrs. Dubose would catch him and make him spell it out. Jem read for perhaps twenty minutes, during which time I looked at the soot-stained mantelpiece, out the window, anywhere to keep from looking at her. As he read along, I noticed that Mrs. Dubose\u2019s corrections grew fewer and farther between, that Jem had even left one sentence dangling in mid-air. She was not listening.I looked toward the bed.Something had happened to her. She lay on her back, with the quilts up to her chin. Only her head and shoulders were visible. Her head moved slowly from side to side. From time to time she would open her mouth wide, and I could see her tongue undulate faintly. Cords of saliva would collect on her lips; she would draw them in, then open her mouth again. Her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own. It worked separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at low tide. Occasionally it would say, \u201cPt,\u201d like some vicious substance coming to a boil.I pulled Jem\u2019s sleeve.He looked at me, then at the bed. Her head made its regular sweep toward us, and Jem said, \u201cMrs. Dubose, are you all right?\u201d She did not hear him.The alarm clock went off and scared us stiff. A minute later, nerves still tingling, Jem and I were on the sidewalk headed for home. We did not run away, Jessie sent us: before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing Jim and me out of it.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cShoo,\u201d she said, \u201cyou all go home.\u201dJem hesitated at the door.\u201cIt\u2019s time for her medicine,\u201d Jessie said. As the door swung shut behind us I saw Jessie walking quickly toward Mrs. Dubose\u2019s bed.It was only three forty-five when we got home, so Jem and I drop-kicked in the back yard until it was time to meet Atticus. Atticus had two yellow pencils for me and a football magazine for Jem, which I suppose was a silent reward for our first day\u2019s session with Mrs. Dubose. Jem told him what happened.\u201cDid she frighten you?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cNo sir,\u201d said Jem, \u201cbut she\u2019s so nasty. She has fits or somethin\u2019. She spits a lot.\u201d\u201cShe can\u2019t help that. When people are sick they don\u2019t look nice sometimes.\u201d\u201cShe scared me,\u201d I said.Atticus looked at me over his glasses. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go with Jem, you know.\u201dThe next afternoon at Mrs. Dubose\u2019s was the same as the first, and so was the next, until gradually a pattern emerged: everything would begin normally\u2014that is, Mrs. Dubose would hound Jem for a while on her favorite subjects, her camellias and our father\u2019s nigger-loving propensities; she would grow increasingly silent, then go away from us. The alarm clock would ring, Jessie would shoo us out, and the rest of the day was ours.\u201cAtticus,\u201d I said one evening, \u201cwhat exactly is a nigger-lover?\u201dAtticus\u2019s face was grave. \u201cHas somebody been calling you that?\u201d\u201cNo sir, Mrs. Dubose calls you that. She warms up every afternoon calling you that. Francis called me that last Christmas, that\u2019s where I first heard it.\u201d\u201cIs that the reason you jumped on him?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cYes sir . . .\u201d\u201cThen why are you asking me what it means?\u201dI tried to explain to Atticus that it wasn\u2019t so much what Francis said that had infuriated me as the way he had said it. \u201cIt was like he\u2019d said snot-nose or somethin\u2019.\u201d\u201cScout,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cnigger-lover is just one of those terms that don\u2019t mean anything\u2014like snot-nose. It\u2019s hard to explain\u2014ignorant, trashy people use it when they think somebody\u2019s favoring Negroes over and above themselves. It\u2019s slipped into usage with some people like ourselves, when they want a common, ugly term to label somebody.\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t really a nigger-lover, then, are you?\u201d\u201cI certainly am. I do my best to love everybody . . . I\u2019m hard put, sometimes\u2014baby, it\u2019s never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesn\u2019t hurt you. So don\u2019t let Mrs. Dubose get you down. She has enough troubles of her own.\u201dOne afternoon a month later Jem was ploughing his way through Sir Walter Scout, as Jem called him, and Mrs. Dubose was correcting him at every turn, when there was a knock on the door. \u201cCome in!\u201d she screamed.Atticus came in. He went to the bed and took Mrs. Dubose\u2019s hand. \u201cI was coming from the office and didn\u2019t see the children,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought they might still be here.\u201dMrs. Dubose smiled at him. For the life of me I could not figure out how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so. \u201cDo you know what time it is, Atticus?\u201d she said. \u201cExactly fourteen minutes past five. The alarm clock\u2019s set for five-thirty. I want you to know that.\u201dIt suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at Mrs. Dubose\u2019s, that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day, and that she was well into one of her fits by the time it sounded. Today she had antagonized Jem for nearly two hours with no intention of having a fit, and I felt hopelessly trapped. The alarm clock was the signal for our release; if one day it did not ring, what would we do?\u201cI have a feeling that Jem\u2019s reading days are numbered,\u201d said Atticus.\u201cOnly a week longer, I think,\u201d she said, \u201cjust to make sure . . .\u201dJem rose. \u201cBut\u2014\u201dAtticus put out his hand and Jem was silent. On the way home, Jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasn\u2019t fair.\u201cJust one more week, son,\u201d said Atticus.\u201cNo,\u201d said Jem.\u201cYes,\u201d said Atticus.The following week found us back at Mrs. Dubose\u2019s. The alarm clock had ceased sounding, but Mrs. Dubose would release us with, \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d so late in the afternoon Atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned. Although her fits had passed off, she was in every other way her old self: when Sir Walter Scott became involved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles, Mrs. Dubose would become bored and pick on us:\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cJeremy Finch, I told you you\u2019d live to regret tearing up my camellias. You regret it now, don\u2019t you?\u201dJem would say he certainly did.\u201cThought you could kill my Snow-on-the-Mountain, did you? Well, Jessie says the top\u2019s growing back out. Next time you\u2019ll know how to do it right, won\u2019t you? You\u2019ll pull it up by the roots, won\u2019t you?\u201dJem would say he certainly would.\u201cDon\u2019t you mutter at me, boy! You hold up your head and say yes ma\u2019am. Don\u2019t guess you feel like holding it up, though, with your father what he is.\u201dJem\u2019s chin would come up, and he would gaze at Mrs. Dubose with a face devoid of resentment. Through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and detached interest, which he would present to her in answer to her most blood-curdling inventions.At last the day came. When Mrs. Dubose said, \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d one afternoon, she added, \u201cAnd that\u2019s all. Good-day to you.\u201dIt was over. We bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief, leaping and howling.That spring was a good one: the days grew longer and gave us more playing time. Jem\u2019s mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football player in the nation. Every night Atticus would read us the sports pages of the newspapers. Alabama might go to the Rose Bowl again this year, judging from its prospects, not one of whose names we could pronounce. Atticus was in the middle of Windy Seaton\u2019s column one evening when the telephone rang.He answered it, then went to the hat rack in the hall. \u201cI\u2019m going down to Mrs. Dubose\u2019s for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201dBut Atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime. When he returned he was carrying a candy box. Atticus sat down in the living-room and put the box on the floor beside his chair.\u201cWhat\u2019d she want?\u201d asked Jem.We had not seen Mrs. Dubose for over a month. She was never on the porch any more when we passed.\u201cShe\u2019s dead, son,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cShe died a few minutes ago.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWell.\u201d\u201cWell is right,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cShe\u2019s not suffering any more. She was sick for a long time. Son, didn\u2019t you know what her fits were?\u201dJem shook his head.\u201cMrs. Dubose was a morphine addict,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cShe took it as a pain-killer for years. The doctor put her on it. She\u2019d have spent the rest of her life on it and died without so much agony, but she was too contrary\u2014\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d said Jem.Atticus said, \u201cJust before your escapade she called me to make her will. Dr. Reynolds told her she had only a few months left. Her business affairs were in perfect order but she said, \u2018There\u2019s still one thing out of order.\u2019 \u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Jem was perplexed.\u201cShe said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody. Jem, when you\u2019re sick as she was, it\u2019s all right to take anything to make it easier, but it wasn\u2019t all right for her. She said she meant to break herself of it before she died, and that\u2019s what she did.\u201dJem said, \u201cYou mean that\u2019s what her fits were?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what they were. Most of the time you were reading to her I doubt if she heard a word you said. Her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarm clock. If you hadn\u2019t fallen into her hands, I\u2019d have made you go read to her anyway. It may have been some distraction. There was another reason\u2014\u201d\u201cDid she die free?\u201d asked Jem.\u201cAs the mountain air,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cShe was conscious to the last, almost. Conscious,\u201d he smiled, \u201cand cantankerous. She still disapproved heartily of my doings, and said I\u2019d probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail. She had Jessie fix you this box\u2014\u201dAtticus reached down and picked up the candy box. He handed it to Jem.Jem opened the box. Inside, surrounded by wads of damp cotton, was a white, waxy, perfect camellia. It was a Snow-on-the-Mountain.Jem\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of his head. \u201cOld hell-devil, old hell-devil!\u201d he screamed, flinging it down. \u201cWhy can\u2019t she leave me alone?\u201dIn a flash Atticus was up and standing over him. Jem buried his face in Atticus\u2019s shirt front. \u201cSh-h,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was her way of telling you\u2014everything\u2019s all right now, Jem, everything\u2019s all right. You know, she was a great lady.\u201d\u201cA lady?\u201d Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. \u201cAfter all those things she said about you, a lady?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cShe was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine, maybe . . . son, I told you that if you hadn\u2019t lost your head I\u2019d have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her\u2014I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It\u2019s when you know you\u2019re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.\u201dJem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire. He picked up the camellia, and when I went off to bed I saw him fingering the wide petals. Atticus was reading the paper.Part Two12Jem was twelve. He was difficult to live with, inconsistent, moody. His appetite was appalling, and he told me so many times to stop pestering him I consulted Atticus: \u201cReckon he\u2019s got a tapeworm?\u201d Atticus said no, Jem was growing. I must be patient with him and disturb him as little as possible.This change in Jem had come about in a matter of weeks. Mrs. Dubose was not cold in her grave\u2014Jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read to her. Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me what to do. After one altercation when Jem hollered, \u201cIt\u2019s time you started bein\u2019 a girl and acting right!\u201d I burst into tears and fled to Calpurnia.\u201cDon\u2019t you fret too much over Mister Jem\u2014\u201d she began.\u201cMis-ter Jem?\u201d\u201cYeah, he\u2019s just about Mister Jem now.\u201d\u201cHe ain\u2019t that old,\u201d I said. \u201cAll he needs is somebody to beat him up, and I ain\u2019t big enough.\u201d\u201cBaby,\u201d said Calpurnia, \u201cI just can\u2019t help it if Mister Jem\u2019s growin\u2019 up. He\u2019s gonna want to be off to himself a lot now, doin\u2019 whatever boys do, so you just come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome. We\u2019ll find lots of things to do in here.\u201dThe beginning of that summer boded well: Jem could do as he pleased; Calpurnia would do until Dill came. She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the kitchen, and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl.But summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from him. The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he would have to stay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His father was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger. Dill\u2019s new father had a pleasant face, which made me glad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry, he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together, so please write.The fact that I had a permanent fianc\u00e9 was little compensation for his absence: I had never thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, Dill\u2019s eyes alive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer was the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not looking, the longings we sometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was routine; without him, life was unbearable. I stayed miserable for two days.As if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency session and Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles off the ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread lines in the cities grew longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were events remote from the world of Jem and me.We were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the Montgomery Advertiser above the caption, \u201cMaycomb\u2019s Finch.\u201d It showed Atticus barefooted and in short pants, chained to a desk: he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous-looking girls yelled, \u201cYoo-hoo!\u201d at him.\u201cThat\u2019s a compliment,\u201d explained Jem. \u201cHe spends his time doin\u2019 things that wouldn\u2019t get done if nobody did \u2019em.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIn addition to Jem\u2019s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a maddening air of wisdom.\u201cOh, Scout, it\u2019s like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things. That kind of thing\u2019s pretty dry to most men.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cOh, go on and leave me alone. I\u2019m readin\u2019 the paper.\u201dJem got his wish. I departed for the kitchen.While she was shelling peas, Calpurnia suddenly said, \u201cWhat am I gonna do about you all\u2019s church this Sunday?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cNothing, I reckon. Atticus left us collection.\u201dCalpurnia\u2019s eyes narrowed and I could tell what was going through her mind. \u201cCal,\u201d I said, \u201cyou know we\u2019ll behave. We haven\u2019t done anything in church in years.\u201dCalpurnia evidently remembered a rainy Sunday when we were both fatherless and teacherless. Left to its own devices, the class tied Eunice Ann Simpson to a chair and placed her in the furnace room. We forgot her, trooped upstairs to church, and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes, persisting until someone investigated and brought forth Eunice Ann saying she didn\u2019t way to play Shadrach any more\u2014Jem Finch said she wouldn\u2019t get burnt if she had enough faith, but it was hot down there.\u201cBesides, Cal, this isn\u2019t the first time Atticus has left us,\u201d I protested.\u201cYeah, but he makes certain your teacher\u2019s gonna be there. I didn\u2019t hear him say this time\u2014reckon he forgot it.\u201d Calpurnia scratched her head. Suddenly she smiled. \u201cHow\u2019d you and Mister Jem like to come to church with me tomorrow?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHow \u2019bout it?\u201d grinned Calpurnia.If Calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing compared to her supervision of that Saturday night\u2019s routine. She made me soap all over twice, drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse; she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with Octagon soap and castile. She had trusted Jem for years, but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst: \u201cCan\u2019t anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin\u2019?\u201dNext morning she began earlier than usual, to \u201cgo over our clothes.\u201d When Calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen; that morning it was covered with our Sunday habiliments. She had put so much starch in my dress it came up like a tent when I sat down. She made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist. She went over my patent-leather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them.\u201cIt\u2019s like we were goin\u2019 to Mardi Gras,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this for, Cal?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody sayin\u2019 I don\u2019t look after my children,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMister Jem, you absolutely can\u2019t wear that tie with that suit. It\u2019s green.\u201d\u201c \u2019smatter with that?\u201d\u201cSuit\u2019s blue. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d\u201cHee hee,\u201d I howled, \u201cJem\u2019s color blind.\u201dHis face flushed angrily, but Calpurnia said, \u201cNow you all quit that. You\u2019re gonna go to First Purchase with smiles on your faces.\u201dFirst Purchase African M.E. Church was in the Quarters outside the southern town limits, across the old sawmill tracks. It was an ancient paint-peeled frame building, the only church in Maycomb with a steeple and bell, called First Purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves. Negroes worshiped in it on Sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays.The churchyard was brick-hard clay, as was the cemetery beside it. If someone died during a dry spell, the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth. A few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones; newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken Coca-Cola bottles. Lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily; stumps of burned-out candles stood at the heads of infant graves. It was a happy cemetery.The warm bittersweet smell of clean Negro welcomed us as we entered the churchyard\u2014Hearts of Love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida, snuff, Hoyt\u2019s Cologne, Brown\u2019s Mule, peppermint, and lilac talcum.When they saw Jem and me with Calpurnia, the men stepped back and took off their hats; the women crossed their arms at their waists, weekday gestures of respectful attention. They parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us. Calpurnia walked between Jem and me, responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors.\u201cWhat you up to, Miss Cal?\u201d said a voice behind us.Calpurnia\u2019s hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around: standing in the path behind us was a tall Negro woman. Her weight was on one leg; she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip, pointing at us with upturned palm. She was bullet-headed with strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and an Indian-bow mouth. She seemed seven feet high.I felt Calpurnia\u2019s hand dig into my shoulder. \u201cWhat you want, Lula?\u201d she asked, in tones I had never heard her use. She spoke quietly, contemptuously.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cI wants to know why you bringin\u2019 white chillun to nigger church.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019s my comp\u2019ny,\u201d said Calpurnia. Again I thought her voice strange: she was talking like the rest of them.\u201cYeah, an\u2019 I reckon you\u2019s comp\u2019ny at the Finch house durin\u2019 the week.\u201dA murmur ran through the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret,\u201d Calpurnia whispered to me, but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly.When Lula came up the pathway toward us Calpurnia said, \u201cStop right there, nigger.\u201dLula stopped, but she said, \u201cYou ain\u2019t got no business bringin\u2019 white chillun here\u2014they got their church, we got our\u2019n. It is our church, ain\u2019t it, Miss Cal?\u201dCalpurnia said, \u201cIt\u2019s the same God, ain\u2019t it?\u201dJem said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home, Cal, they don\u2019t want us here\u2014\u201dI agreed: they did not want us here. I sensed, rather than saw, that we were being advanced upon. They seemed to be drawing closer to us, but when I looked up at Calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes. When I looked down the pathway again, Lula was gone. In her place was a solid mass of colored people.One of them stepped from the crowd. It was Zeebo, the garbage collector. \u201cMister Jem,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re mighty glad to have you all here. Don\u2019t pay no \u2019tention to Lula, she\u2019s contentious because Reverend Sykes threatened to church her. She\u2019s a troublemaker from way back, got fancy ideas an\u2019 haughty ways\u2014we\u2019re mighty glad to have you all.\u201dWith that, Calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by Reverend Sykes, who led us to the front pew.First Purchase was unceiled and unpainted within. Along its walls unlighted kerosense lamps hung on brass brackets; pine benches served as pews. Behind the rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed God Is Love, the church\u2019s only decoration except a roto-gravure print of Hunt\u2019s The Light of the World. There was no sign of piano, organ, hymn-books, church programs\u2014the familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every Sunday. It was dim inside, with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation. At each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish Garden of Gethsemane, courtesy Tyndal\u2019s Hardware Co. (You-Name-It-We-Sell-It).Calpurnia motioned Jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us. She fished in her purse, drew out her handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of change in its corner. She gave a dime to me and a dime to Jem. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ours,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou keep it,\u201d Calpurnia said, \u201cyou\u2019re my company.\u201d Jem\u2019s face showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket. I did likewise with no qualms.\u201cCal,\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhere are the hymn-books?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have any,\u201d she said.\u201cWell how\u2014?\u201d\u201cSh-h,\u201d she said. Reverend Sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the congregation to silence. He was a short, stocky man in a black suit, black tie, white shirt, and a gold watch-chain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows.He said, \u201cBrethren and sisters, we are particularly glad to have company with us this morning. Mister and Miss Finch. You all know their father. Before I begin I will read some announcements.\u201dReverend Sykes shuffled some papers, chose one and held it at arm\u2019s length. \u201cThe Missionary Society meets in the home of Sister Annette Reeves next Tuesday. Bring your sewing.\u201dHe read from another paper. \u201cYou all know of Brother Tom Robinson\u2019s trouble. He has been a faithful member of First Purchase since he was a boy. The collection taken up today and for the next three Sundays will go to Helen\u2014his wife, to help her out at home.\u201dI punched Jem. \u201cThat\u2019s the Tom Atticus\u2019s de\u2014\u201d\u201cSh-h!\u201dI turned to Calpurnia but was hushed before I opened my mouth. Subdued, I fixed my attention upon Reverend Sykes, who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down. \u201cWill the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn,\u201d he said.Zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle, stopping in front of us and facing the congregation. He was carrying a battered hymn-book. He opened it and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll sing number two seventy-three.\u201dThis was too much for me. \u201cHow\u2019re we gonna sing it if there ain\u2019t any hymn-books?\u201dCalpurnia smiled. \u201cHush baby,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou\u2019ll see in a minute.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery:\u201cThere\u2019s a land beyond the river.\u201dMiraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out Zeebo\u2019s words. The last syllable, held to a husky hum, was followed by Zeebo saying,\u201cThat we call the sweet forever.\u201dMusic again swelled around us; the last note lingered and Zeebo met it with the next line: \u201cAnd we only reach that shore by faith\u2019s decree.\u201dThe congregation hesitated, Zeebo repeated the line carefully, and it was sung. At the chorus Zeebo closed the book, a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help.On the dying notes of \u201cJubilee,\u201d Zeebo said, \u201cIn that far-off sweet forever, just beyond the shining river.\u201dLine for line, voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur.I looked at Jem, who was looking at Zeebo from the corners of his eyes. I didn\u2019t believe it either, but we had both heard it.Reverend Sykes then called on the Lord to bless the sick and the suffering, a procedure no different from our church practice, except Reverend Sykes directed the Deity\u2019s attention to several specific cases.His sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin, an austere declaration of the motto on the wall behind him: he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews, gambling, and strange women. Bootleggers caused enough trouble in the Quarters, but women were worse. Again, as I had often met it in my own church, I was confronted with the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.Jem and I had heard the same sermon Sunday after Sunday, with only one exception. Reverend Sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapses from grace: Jim Hardy had been absent from church for five Sundays and he wasn\u2019t sick; Constance Jackson had better watch her ways\u2014she was in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbors; she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the Quarters.Reverend Sykes closed his sermon. He stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and requested the morning offering, a proceeding that was strange to Jem and me. One by one, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can. Jem and I followed suit, and received a soft, \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d as our dimes clinked.To our amazement, Reverend Sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the coins into his hand. He straightened up and said, \u201cThis is not enough, we must have ten dollars.\u201dThe congregation stirred. \u201cYou all know what it\u2019s for\u2014Helen can\u2019t leave those children to work while Tom\u2019s in jail. If everybody gives one more dime, we\u2019ll have it\u2014\u201d Reverend Sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church. \u201cAlec, shut the doors. Nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars.\u201dCalpurnia scratched in her handbag, and brought forth a battered leather coin purse. \u201cNow Cal,\u201d Jem whispered, when she handed him a shiny quarter, \u201cwe can put ours in. Gimme your dime, Scout.\u201dThe church was becoming stuffy, and it occurred to me that Reverend Sykes intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock. Fans crackled, feet shuffled, tobacco-chewers were in agony.Reverend Sykes startled me by saying sternly, \u201cCarlow Richardson, I haven\u2019t seen you up this aisle yet.\u201dA thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin. The congregation murmured approval.Reverend Sykes then said, \u201cI want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice and give one more dime apiece. Then we\u2019ll have it.\u201dSlowly, painfully, the ten dollars was collected. The door was opened, and the gust of warm air revived us. Zeebo lined On Jordan\u2019s Stormy Banks, and church was over.I wanted to stay and explore, but Calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her. At the church door, while she paused to talk with Zeebo and his family, Jem and I chatted with Reverend Sykes. I was bursting with questions, but decided I would wait and let Calpurnia answer them.\u201cWe were \u2019specially glad to have you all here,\u201d said Reverend Sykes. \u201cThis church has no better friend than your daddy.\u201dMy curiosity burst: \u201cWhy were you all takin\u2019 up collection for Tom Robinson\u2019s wife?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear why?\u201d asked Reverend Sykes. \u201cHelen\u2019s got three little\u2019uns and she can\u2019t go out to work\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t she take \u2019em with her, Reverend?\u201d I asked. It was customary for field Negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while their parents worked\u2014usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton. Those unable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothers\u2019 backs, or resided in extra cotton bags.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Reverend Sykes hesitated. \u201cTo tell you the truth, Miss Jean Louise, Helen\u2019s finding it hard to get work these days . . . when it\u2019s picking time, I think Mr. Link Deas\u2019ll take her.\u201d\u201cWhy not, Reverend?\u201dBefore he could answer, I felt Calpurnia\u2019s hand on my shoulder. At its pressure I said, \u201cWe thank you for lettin\u2019 us come.\u201d Jem echoed me, and we made our way homeward.\u201cCal, I know Tom Robinson\u2019s in jail an\u2019 he\u2019s done somethin\u2019 awful, but why won\u2019t folks hire Helen?\u201d I asked.Calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between Jem and me. \u201cIt\u2019s because of what folks say Tom\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cFolks aren\u2019t anxious to\u2014to have anything to do with any of his family.\u201d\u201cJust what did he do, Cal?\u201dCalpurnia sighed. \u201cOld Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin\u2019 his girl an\u2019 had him arrested an\u2019 put in jail\u2014\u201d\u201cMr. Ewell?\u201d My memory stirred. \u201cDoes he have anything to do with those Ewells that come every first day of school an\u2019 then go home? Why, Atticus said they were absolute trash\u2014I never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the Ewells. He said\u2014\u201d\u201cYeah, those are the ones.\u201d\u201cWell, if everybody in Maycomb knows what kind of folks the Ewells are they\u2019d be glad to hire Helen . . . what\u2019s rape, Cal?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s somethin\u2019 you\u2019ll have to ask Mr. Finch about,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can explain it better than I can. You all hungry? The Reverend took a long time unwindin\u2019 this morning, he\u2019s not usually so tedious.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just like our preacher,\u201d said Jem, \u201cbut why do you all sing hymns that way?\u201d\u201cLinin\u2019?\u201d she asked.\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s called linin\u2019. They\u2019ve done it that way as long as I can remember.\u201dJem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some hymn-books.Calpurnia laughed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do any good,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t read.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t read?\u201d I asked. \u201cAll those folks?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Calpurnia nodded. \u201cCan\u2019t but about four folks in First Purchase read . . . I\u2019m one of \u2019em.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019d you go to school, Cal?\u201d asked Jem.\u201cNowhere. Let\u2019s see now, who taught me my letters? It was Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s aunt, old Miss Buford\u2014\u201d\u201cAre you that old?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m older than Mr. Finch, even.\u201d Calpurnia grinned. \u201cNot sure how much, though. We started rememberin\u2019 one time, trying to figure out how old I was\u2014I can remember back just a few years more\u2019n he can, so I\u2019m not much older, when you take off the fact that men can\u2019t remember as well as women.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your birthday, Cal?\u201d\u201cI just have it on Christmas, it\u2019s easier to remember that way\u2014I don\u2019t have a real birthday.\u201d\u201cBut Cal,\u201d Jem protested, \u201cyou don\u2019t look even near as old as Atticus.\u201d\u201cColored folks don\u2019t show their ages so fast,\u201d she said.\u201cMaybe because they can\u2019t read. Cal, did you teach Zeebo?\u201d\u201cYeah, Mister Jem. There wasn\u2019t a school even when he was a boy. I made him learn, though.\u201dZeebo was Calpurnia\u2019s eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have known that Calpurnia was of mature years\u2014Zeebo had half-grown children\u2014but then I had never thought about it.\u201cDid you teach him out of a primer, like us?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss Buford taught me out of\u2014bet you don\u2019t know where I got it,\u201d she said.We didn\u2019t know.Calpurnia said, \u201cYour Grandaddy Finch gave it to me.\u201d\u201cWere you from the Landing?\u201d Jem asked. \u201cYou never told us that.\u201d\u201cI certainly am, Mister Jem. Grew up down there between the Buford Place and the Landin\u2019. I\u2019ve spent all my days workin\u2019 for the Finches or the Bufords, an\u2019 I moved to Maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married.\u201d\u201cWhat was the book, Cal?\u201d I asked.\u201cBlackstone\u2019s Commentaries.\u201dJem was thunderstruck. \u201cYou mean you taught Zeebo outa that?\u201d</p>\n<p> \n\u201cWhy yes sir, Mister Jem.\u201d Calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth. \u201cThey were the only books I had. Your grandaddy said Mr. Blackstone wrote fine English\u2014\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t talk like the rest of \u2019em,\u201d said Jem.\u201cThe rest of who?\u201d\u201cRest of the colored folks. Cal, but you talked like they did in church. . . .\u201dThat Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of her having command of two languages.\u201cCal,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhy do you talk nigger-talk to the\u2014to your folks when you know it\u2019s not right?\u201d\u201cWell, in the first place I\u2019m black\u2014\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you hafta talk that way when you know better,\u201d said Jem.Calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head, then pressed her hat down carefully over her ears. \u201cIt\u2019s right hard to say,\u201d she said. \u201cSuppose you and Scout talked colored-folks\u2019 talk at home\u2014it\u2019d be out of place, wouldn\u2019t it? Now what if I talked white-folks\u2019 talk at church, and with my neighbors? They\u2019d think I was puttin\u2019 on airs to beat Moses.\u201d\u201cBut Cal, you know better,\u201d I said.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to tell all you know. It\u2019s not ladylike\u2014in the second place, folks don\u2019t like to have somebody around knowin\u2019 more than they do. It aggravates \u2019em. You\u2019re not gonna change any of them by talkin\u2019 right, they\u2019ve got to want to learn themselves, and when they don\u2019t want to learn there\u2019s nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language.\u201d\u201cCal, can I come to see you sometimes?\u201dShe looked down at me. \u201cSee me, honey? You see me every day.\u201d\u201cOut to your house,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes after work? Atticus can get me.\u201d\u201cAny time you want to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d be glad to have you.\u201dWe were on the sidewalk by the Radley Place.\u201cLook on the porch yonder,\u201d Jem said.I looked over to the Radley Place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing. The swing was empty.\u201cI mean our porch,\u201d said Jem.I looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt Alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.13\u201cPut my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia,\u201d was the first thing Aunt Alexandra said. \u201cJean Louise, stop scratching your head,\u201d was the second thing she said.Calpurnia picked up Aunty\u2019s heavy suitcase and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Jem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The sound had a dull permanence about it.\u201cHave you come for a visit, Aunty?\u201d I asked. Aunt Alexandra\u2019s visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned a bright green square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state of tidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.\u201cDidn\u2019t your father tell you?\u201d she asked.Jem and I shook our heads.\u201cProbably he forgot. He\u2019s not in yet, is he?\u201d\u201cNome, he doesn\u2019t usually get back till late afternoon,\u201d said Jem.\u201cWell, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you for a while.\u201d\u201cFor a while\u201d in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem and I exchanged glances.\u201cJem\u2019s growing up now and you are too,\u201d she said to me. \u201cWe decided that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence. It won\u2019t be many years, Jean Louise, before you become interested in clothes and boys\u2014\u201dI could have made several answers to this: Cal\u2019s a girl, it would be many years before I would be interested in boys, I would never be interested in clothes . . . but I kept quiet.\u201cWhat about Uncle Jimmy?\u201d asked Jem. \u201cIs he comin\u2019, too?\u201d\u201cOh no, he\u2019s staying at the Landing. He\u2019ll keep the place going.\u201dThe moment I said, \u201cWon\u2019t you miss him?\u201d I realized that this was not a tactful question. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not much difference, he never said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my question.I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to say to her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are you, Jean Louise? Fine, thank you ma\u2019am, how are you? Very well, thank you; what have you been doing with yourself? Nothin\u2019. Don\u2019t you do anything? Nome. Certainly you have friends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin\u2019.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her tell Atticus that I was sluggish.There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then: today was Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lord\u2019s Day. I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, and managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandra\u2019s was once an hour-glass figure. From any angle, it was formidable.The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It was Atticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him. Jem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss and said, \u201c\u2019dyou bring me a book? \u2019dyou know Aunty\u2019s here?\u201dAtticus answered both questions in the affirmative. \u201cHow\u2019d you like for her to come live with us?\u201dI said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one can\u2019t do anything about them.\u201cWe felt it was time you children needed\u2014well, it\u2019s like this, Scout,\u201d Atticus said. \u201cYour aunt\u2019s doing me a favor as well as you all. I can\u2019t stay here all day with you, and the summer\u2019s going to be a hot one.\u201d\u201cYes sir,\u201d I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that Aunt Alexandra\u2019s appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus\u2019s doing as hers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose her coming to live with us was in that category.Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt Alexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, \u201cUh, uh, uh.\u201d Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her.When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and became Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and participating in the life of the country, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral come along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. She was never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn.She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than annoyed him: \u201cAunty better watch how she talks\u2014scratch most folks in Maycomb and they\u2019re kin to us.\u201dAunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather\u2019s suicide, said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl giggle in the choir and Aunty would say, \u201cIt just goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty.\u201d Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak, a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford\u2019s tendency to mind other people\u2019s business was hereditary, Atticus said: \u201cSister, when you stop to think about it, our generation\u2019s practically the first in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?\u201dAunty said no, that\u2019s where we got our small hands and feet.I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.\u201cThat makes the Ewells fine folks, then,\u201d said Jem. The tribe of which Burris Ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the Maycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.Aunt Alexandra\u2019s theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an ancient town. It was twenty miles east of Finch\u2019s Landing, awkwardly inland for such an old town. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created county\u2019s domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield\u2019s guests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not Sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle of Winston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub, Sinkfield\u2019s Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps and charts, lop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements. He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags\u2014two apiece and one for the Governor.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning its buildings were solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide. Maycomb\u2019s proportion of professional people ran high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed, his heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules vetted. But the ultimate wisdom of Sinkfield\u2019s maneuver is open to question. He placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those days\u2014river-boat\u2014and it took a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for store-bought goods. As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland.Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States, Reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward. New people so rarely settled there, the same families married the same families until the members of the community looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery or Mobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early years.There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way: the old citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and years, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted attitudes, character shadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined by time. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third Merriweather Is Morbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simply guides to daily living: never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to the bank; Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. Grace Merriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles it\u2019s nothing unusual\u2014her mother did the same.Aunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a glove, but never into the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how she could be Atticus\u2019s and Uncle Jack\u2019s sister that I revived half-remembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots that Jem had spun long ago.These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little to say to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went to bed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I would run inside for a drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb ladies, sipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: \u201cJean Louise, come speak to these ladies.\u201dWhen I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted her request; I was usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.\u201cSpeak to your Cousin Lily,\u201d she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in the hall.\u201cWho?\u201d I said.\u201cYour Cousin Lily Brooke,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra.\u201cShe our cousin? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201dAunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to Cousin Lily and firm disapproval of me. When Cousin Lily Brooke left I knew I was in for it.It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family, or to install any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the sofa beside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on which Meditations of Joshua S. St. Clair was stamped in gold.\u201cYour cousin wrote this,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra. \u201cHe was a beautiful character.\u201dJem examined the small volume. \u201cIs this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up for so long?\u201dAunt Alexandra said, \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\u201cWhy, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot the president. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn\u2019t anything but a sewer-inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in his hand. Atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one\u2014\u201dAunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about this.\u201dBefore bedtime I was in Jem\u2019s room trying to borrow a book, when Atticus knocked and entered. He sat on the side of Jem\u2019s bed, looked at us soberly, then he grinned.\u201cEr\u2014h\u2019rm,\u201d he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said with a throaty noise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know how to say this,\u201d he began.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWell, just say it,\u201d said Jem. \u201cHave we done something?\u201dOur father was actually fidgeting. \u201cNo, I just want to explain to you that\u2014your Aunt Alexandra asked me . . . son, you know you\u2019re a Finch, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice rose uncontrollably. \u201cAtticus, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dAtticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you the facts of life.\u201dJem\u2019s disgust deepened. \u201cI know all that stuff,\u201d he said.Atticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyer\u2019s voice, without a shade of inflection, he said: \u201cYour aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations\u2019 gentle breeding\u2014\u201d Atticus paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg.\u201cGentle breeding,\u201d he continued, when I had found and scratched it, \u201cand that you should try to live up to your name\u2014\u201d Atticus persevered in spite of us: \u201cShe asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are. She wants to talk to you about the family and what it\u2019s meant to Maycomb County through the years, so you\u2019ll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behave accordingly,\u201d he concluded at a gallop.Stunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose collar seemed to worry him. We did not speak to him.Presently I picked up a comb from Jem\u2019s dresser and ran its teeth along the edge.\u201cStop that noise,\u201d Atticus said.His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down. For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father. My father never thought these thoughts. My father never spoke so. Aunt Alexandra had put him up to this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem standing in a similar pool of isolation, his head cocked to one side.There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticus\u2019s vest front. I buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light blue cloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft sound of his breathing.\u201cYour stomach\u2019s growling,\u201d I said.\u201cI know it,\u201d he said.\u201cYou better take some soda.\u201d\u201cI will,\u201d he said.\u201cAtticus, is all this behavin\u2019 an\u2019 stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you\u2014?\u201dI felt his hand on the back of my head. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to worry.\u201dWhen I heard that, I knew he had come back to us. The blood in my legs began to flow again, and I raised my head. \u201cYou really want us to do all that? I can\u2019t remember everything Finches are supposed to do . . .\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to remember it. Forget it.\u201dHe went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind him. He nearly slammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly. As Jem and I stared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around. His eyebrows were raised, his glasses had slipped. \u201cGet more like Cousin Joshua every day, don\u2019t I? Do you think I\u2019ll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?\u201dI know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It takes a woman to do that kind of work.14Although we heard no more about the Finch family from Aunt Alexandra, we heard plenty from the town. On Saturdays, armed with our nickels, when Jem permitted me to accompany him (he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public), we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear, \u201cThere\u2019s his chillun,\u201d or, \u201cYonder\u2019s some Finches.\u201d Turning to face our accusers, we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the Mayco Drugstore window. Or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a Hoover cart.\u201cThey c\u2019n go loose and rape up the countryside for all \u2019em who run this county care,\u201d was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed us. Which reminded me that I had a question to ask Atticus.\u201cWhat\u2019s rape?\u201d I asked him that night.Atticus looked around from behind his paper. He was in his chair by the window. As we grew older, Jem and I thought it generous to allow Atticus thirty minutes to himself after supper.He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWell if that\u2019s all it is why did Calpurnia dry me up when I asked her what it was?\u201dAtticus looked pensive. \u201cWhat\u2019s that again?\u201d\u201cWell, I asked Calpurnia comin\u2019 from church that day what it was and she said ask you but I forgot to and now I\u2019m askin\u2019 you.\u201dHis paper was now in his lap. \u201cAgain, please,\u201d he said.I told him in detail about our trip to church with Calpurnia. Atticus seemed to enjoy it, but Aunt Alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put down her embroidery and stared at us.\u201cYou all were coming back from Calpurnia\u2019s church that Sunday?\u201dJem said, \u201cYessum, she took us.\u201dI remembered something. \u201cYessum, and she promised me I could come out to her house some afternoon. Atticus, I\u2019ll go next Sunday if it\u2019s all right, can I? Cal said she\u2019d come get me if you were off in the car.\u201d\u201cYou may not.\u201dAunt Alexandria said it. I wheeled around, startled, then turned back to Atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her, but it was too late. I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you!\u201dFor a big man, Atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone I ever knew. He was on his feet. \u201cApologize to your aunt,\u201d he said.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask her, I asked you\u2014\u201dAtticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye. His voice was deadly: \u201cFirst, apologize to your aunt.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Aunty,\u201d I muttered.\u201cNow then,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get this clear: you do as Calpurnia tells you, you do as I tell you, and as long as your aunt\u2019s in this house, you will do as she tells you. Understand?\u201dI understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way I could retire with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom, where I stayed long enough to make them think I had to go. Returning, I lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on in the livingroom. Through the door I could see Jem on the sofa with a football magazine in front of his face, his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match.\u201c. . . you\u2019ve got to do something about her,\u201d Aunty was saying. \u201cYou\u2019ve let things go on too long, Atticus, too long.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see any harm in letting her go out there. Cal\u2019d look after her there as well as she does here.\u201dWho was the \u201cher\u201d they were talking about? My heart sank: me. I felt the starched walls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me, and for the second time in my life I thought of running away. Immediately.\u201cAtticus, it\u2019s all right to be soft-hearted, you\u2019re an easy man, but you have a daughter to think of. A daughter who\u2019s growing up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I am thinking of.\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to get around it. You\u2019ve got to face it sooner or later and it might as well be tonight. We don\u2019t need her now.\u201dAtticus\u2019s voice was even: \u201cAlexandra, Calpurnia\u2019s not leaving this house until she wants to. You may think otherwise, but I couldn\u2019t have got along without her all these years. She\u2019s a faithful member of this family and you\u2019ll simply have to accept things the way they are. Besides, sister, I don\u2019t want you working your head off for us\u2014you\u2019ve no reason to do that. We still need Cal as much as we ever did.\u201d\u201cBut Atticus\u2014\u201d\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think the children\u2019ve suffered one bit from her having brought them up. If anything, she\u2019s been harder on them in some ways than a mother would have been . . . she\u2019s never let them get away with anything, she\u2019s never indulged them the way most colored nurses do. She tried to bring them up according to her lights, and Cal\u2019s lights are pretty good\u2014and another thing, the children love her.\u201dI breathed again. It wasn\u2019t me, it was only Calpurnia they were talking about. Revived, I entered the livingroom. Atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and Aunt Alexandra was worrying her embroidery. Punk, punk, punk, her needle broke the taut circle. She stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk. She was furious.Jem got up and padded across the rug. He motioned me to follow. He led me to his room and closed the door. His face was grave.\u201cThey\u2019ve been fussing, Scout.\u201dJem and I fussed a great deal these days, but I had never heard of or seen anyone quarrel with Atticus. It was not a comfortable sight.\u201cScout, try not to antagonize Aunty, hear?\u201dAtticus\u2019s remarks were still rankling, which made me miss the request in Jem\u2019s question. My feathers rose again. \u201cYou tryin\u2019 to tell me what to do?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cNaw, it\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d Atticus didn\u2019t appear to have anything especially on his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s this Tom Robinson case that\u2019s worryin\u2019 him to death\u2014\u201dI said Atticus didn\u2019t worry about anything. Besides, the case never bothered us except about once a week and then it didn\u2019t last.\u201cThat\u2019s because you can\u2019t hold something in your mind but a little while,\u201d said Jem. \u201cIt\u2019s different with grown folks, we\u2014\u201dHis maddening superiority was unbearable these days. He didn\u2019t want to do anything but read and go off by himself. Still, everything he read he passed along to me, but with this difference: formerly because he thought I\u2019d like it; now, for my edification and instruction.\u201cJee crawling hova, Jem! Who do you think you are?\u201d\u201cNow I mean it, Scout, you antagonize Aunty and I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll spank you.\u201dWith that, I was gone. \u201cYou damn morphodite, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d He was sitting on the bed, and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth. He slapped me and I tried another left, but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor. It nearly knocked the breath out of me, but it didn\u2019t matter because I knew he was fighting, he was fighting me back. We were still equals.\u201cAin\u2019t so high and mighty now, are you!\u201d I screamed, sailing in again. He was still on the bed and I couldn\u2019t get a firm stance, so I threw myself at him as hard as I could, hitting, pulling, pinching, gouging. What had begun as a fist-fight became a brawl. We were still struggling when Atticus separated us.\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of you go to bed right now.\u201d\u201cTaah!\u201d I said at Jem. He was being sent to bed at my bedtime.\u201cWho started it?\u201d asked Atticus, in resignation.\u201cJem did. He was tryin\u2019 to tell me what to do. I don\u2019t have to mind him now, do I?\u201dAtticus smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s leave it at this: you mind Jem whenever he can make you. Fair enough?\u201dAunt Alexandra was present but silent, and when she went down the hall with Atticus we heard her say, \u201c. . . just one of the things I\u2019ve been telling you about,\u201d a phrase that united us again.Ours were adjoining rooms; as I shut the door between them Jem said, \u201cNight, Scout.\u201d\u201cNight,\u201d I murmured, picking my way across the room to turn on the light. As I passed the bed I stepped on something warm, resilient, and rather smooth. It was not quite like hard rubber, and I had the sensation that it was alive. I also heard it move.I switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed. Whatever I had stepped on was gone. I tapped on Jem\u2019s door.\u201cWhat,\u201d he said.\u201cHow does a snake feel?\u201d\u201cSort of rough. Cold. Dusty. Why?\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s one under my bed. Can you come look?\u201d\u201cAre you bein\u2019 funny?\u201d Jem opened the door. He was in his pajama bottoms. I noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth. When he saw I meant what I said, he said, \u201cIf you think I\u2019m gonna put my face down to a snake you\u2019ve got another think comin\u2019. Hold on a minute.\u201dHe went to the kitchen and fetched the broom. \u201cYou better get up on the bed,\u201d he said.\u201cYou reckon it\u2019s really one?\u201d I asked. This was an occasion. Our houses had no cellars; they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground, and the entry of reptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace. Miss Rachel Haverford\u2019s excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet, on her washing, when she went to hang up her negligee.Jem made a tentative swipe under the bed. I looked over the foot to see if a snake would come out. None did. Jem made a deeper swipe.\u201cDo snakes grunt?\u201d\u201cIt ain\u2019t a snake,\u201d Jem said. \u201cIt\u2019s somebody.\u201dSuddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed. Jem raised the broom and missed Dill\u2019s head by an inch when it appeared.\u201cGod Almighty.\u201d Jem\u2019s voice was reverent.We watched Dill emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up and eased his shoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets, rubbed the back of his neck. His circulation restored, he said, \u201cHey.\u201dJem petitioned God again. I was speechless.\u201cI\u2019m \u2019bout to perish,\u201d said Dill. \u201cGot anything to eat?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "In a dream, I went to the kitchen. I brought him back some milk and half a pan of corn bread left over from supper. Dill devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as was his custom.I finally found my voice. \u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201dBy an involved route. Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement (there were basements in Meridian) by his new father, who disliked him, and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmer who heard his cries for help (the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through the ventilator), Dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall. Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all over Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County, Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way.\u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d asked Jem.He had taken thirteen dollars from his mother\u2019s purse, caught the nine o\u2019clock from Meridian and got off at Maycomb Junction. He had walked ten or eleven of the fourteen miles to Maycomb, off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seeking him, and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cotton wagon. He had been under the bed for two hours, he thought; he had heard us in the diningroom, and the clink of forks on plates nearly drove him crazy. He thought Jem and I would never go to bed; he had considered emerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jem had grown far taller, but he knew Mr. Finch would break it up soon, so he thought it best to stay where he was. He was worn out, dirty beyond belief, and home.\u201cThey must now know you\u2019re here,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWe\u2019d know if they were lookin\u2019 for you. . . .\u201d\u201cThink they\u2019re still searchin\u2019 all the picture shows in Meridian.\u201d Dill grinned.\u201cYou oughta let your mother know where you are,\u201d said Jem. \u201cYou oughta let her know you\u2019re here. . . .\u201dDill\u2019s eyes flickered at Jem, and Jem looked at the floor. Then he rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall. \u201cAtticus,\u201d his voice was distant, \u201ccan you come here a minute, sir?\u201dBeneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dill\u2019s face went white. I felt sick. Atticus was in the doorway.He came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets, looking down at Dill.I finally found my voice: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dill. When he wants you to know somethin\u2019, he tells you.\u201dDill looked at me. \u201cI mean it\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know he wouldn\u2019t bother you, you know you ain\u2019t scared of Atticus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not scared . . .\u201d Dill muttered.\u201cJust hungry, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d Atticus\u2019s voice had its usual pleasant dryness. \u201cScout, we can do better than a pan of cold corn bread, can\u2019t we? You fill this fellow up and when I get back we\u2019ll see what we can see.\u201d\u201cMr. Finch, don\u2019t tell Aunt Rachel, don\u2019t make me go back, please sir! I\u2019ll run off again\u2014!\u201d\u201cWhoa, son,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cNobody\u2019s about to make you go anywhere but to bed pretty soon. I\u2019m just over to tell Miss Rachel you\u2019re here and ask her if you could spend the night with us\u2014you\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? And for goodness\u2019 sake put some of the county back where it belongs, the soil erosion\u2019s bad enough as it is.\u201dDill stared at my father\u2019s retreating figure.\u201cHe\u2019s tryin\u2019 to be funny,\u201d I said. \u201cHe means take a bath. See there, I told you he wouldn\u2019t bother you.\u201dJem was standing in a corner of the room, looking like the traitor he was. \u201cDill, I had to tell him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t run three hundred miles off without your mother knowin\u2019.\u201dWe left him without a word.Dill ate, and ate, and ate. He hadn\u2019t eaten since last night. He used all his money for a ticket, boarded the train as he had done many times, coolly chatted with the conductor, to whom Dill was a familiar sight, but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on small children traveling a distance alone: if you\u2019ve lost your money the conductor will lend you enough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line.Dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and beans in the pantry when Miss Rachel\u2019s Do-oo Je-sus went off in the hall. He shivered like a rabbit.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "He bore with fortitude her Wait Till I Get You Home, Your Folks Are Out of Their Minds Worryin\u2019, was quite calm during That\u2019s All the Harris in You Coming Out, smiled at her Reckon You Can Stay One Night, and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him.Atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face.\u201cYour father\u2019s tired,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra, her first words in hours, it seemed. She had been there, but I suppose struck dumb most of the time. \u201cYou children get to bed now.\u201cWe left them in the diningroom, Atticus still mopping his face. \u201cFrom rape to riot to runaways,\u201d we heard him chuckle. \u201cI wonder what the next two hours will bring.\u201cSince things appeared to have worked out pretty well, Dill and I decided to be civil to Jem. Besides, Dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him.I put on my pajamas, read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep my eyes open. Dill and Jem were quiet; when I turned off my reading lamp there was no strip of light under the door to Jem\u2019s room.I must have slept a long time, for when I was punched awake the room was dim with the light of the setting moon.\u201cMove over, Scout.\u201d\u201cHe thought he had to,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cDon\u2019t stay mad with him.\u201dDill got in bed beside me. \u201cI ain\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to sleep with you. Are you waked up?\u201dBy this time I was, but lazily so. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201dNo answer. \u201cI said why\u2019d you run off? Was he really hateful like you said?\u201d\u201cNaw . . .\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna?\u201d\u201cHe just said we would. We never did.\u201dI raised up on my elbow, facing Dill\u2019s outline. \u201cIt\u2019s no reason to run off. They don\u2019t get around to doin\u2019 what they say they\u2019re gonna do half the time. . . .\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t it, he\u2014they just wasn\u2019t interested in me.\u201dThis was the weirdest reason for flight I had ever heard. \u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cWell, they stayed gone all the time, and when they were home, even, they\u2019d get off in a room by themselves.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019d they do in there?\u201d\u201cNothin\u2019, just sittin\u2019 and readin\u2019\u2014but they didn\u2019t want me with \u2019em.\u201dI pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up. \u201cYou know something? I was fixin\u2019 to run off tonight because there they all were. You don\u2019t want \u2019em around you all the time, Dill\u2014\u201dDill breathed his patient breath, a half-sigh.\u201c\u2014good night, Atticus\u2019s gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the legislature and I don\u2019t know what\u2014you don\u2019t want \u2019em around all the time, Dill, you couldn\u2019t do anything if they were.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dAs Dill explained, I found myself wondering what life would be if Jem were different, even from what he was now; what I would do if Atticus did not feel the necessity of my presence, help and advice. Why, he couldn\u2019t get along a day without me. Even Calpurnia couldn\u2019t get along unless I was there. They needed me.\u201cDill, you ain\u2019t telling me right\u2014your folks couldn\u2019t do without you. They must be just mean to you. Tell you what to do about that\u2014\u201dDill\u2019s voice went on steadily in the darkness: \u201cThe thing is, what I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to say is\u2014they do get on a lot better without me, I can\u2019t help them any. They ain\u2019t mean. They buy me everything I want, but it\u2019s now-you\u2019ve-got-it-go-play-with-it. You\u2019ve got a roomful of things. I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it.\u201d Dill tried to deepen his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not a boy. Boys get out and play baseball with other boys, they don\u2019t hang around the house worryin\u2019 their folks.\u201dDill\u2019s voice was his own again: \u201cOh, they ain\u2019t mean. They kiss you and hug you good night and good mornin\u2019 and goodbye and tell you they love you\u2014Scout, let\u2019s get us a baby.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201dThere was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. Aunty said God drops \u2019em down the chimney. At least that\u2019s what I think she said.\u201d For once, Aunty\u2019s diction had not been too clear.\u201cWell that ain\u2019t so. You get babies from each other. But there\u2019s this man, too\u2014he has all these babies just waitin\u2019 to wake up, he breathes life into \u2019em. . . .\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Dill was off again. Beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head. He could read two books to my one, but he preferred the magic of his own inventions. He could add and subtract faster than lightning, but he preferred his own twilight world, a world where babies slept, waiting to be gathered like morning lilies. He was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown doors.\u201cDill?\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cWhy do you reckon Boo Radley\u2019s never run off?\u201dDill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me.\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t have anywhere to run off to. . . .\u201d15After many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant, and a long forgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that Dill could stay. We had a week of peace together. After that, little, it seemed. A nightmare was upon us.It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was in her chair in the corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the floor reading. It had been a placid week: I had minded Aunty; Jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped Dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make Boo Radley come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to the front yard and he\u2019d follow it, like an ant). There was a knock on the front door, Jem answered it and said it was Mr. Heck Tate.\u201cWell, ask him to come in,\u201d said Atticus.\u201cI already did. There\u2019s some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out.\u201dIn Maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons: death and politics. I wondered who had died. Jem and I went to the front door, but Atticus called, \u201cGo back in the house.\u201dJem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen. Aunt Alexandra protested. \u201cJust for a second, Aunty, let\u2019s see who it is,\u201d he said.Dill and I took another window. A crowd of men was standing around Atticus. They all seemed to be talking at once.\u201c. . . movin\u2019 him to the county jail tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Tate was saying, \u201cI don\u2019t look for any trouble, but I can\u2019t guarantee there won\u2019t be any. . . .\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish, Heck,\u201d Atticus said. \u201cThis is Maycomb.\u201d\u201c. . . said I was just uneasy.\u201d\u201cHeck, we\u2019ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure there\u2019s nothing to be uneasy about. This is Saturday,\u201d Atticus said. \u201cTrial\u2019ll probably be Monday. You can keep him one night, can\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think anybody in Maycomb\u2019ll begrudge me a client, with times this hard.\u201dThere was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when Mr. Link Deas said, \u201cNobody around here\u2019s up to anything, it\u2019s that Old Sarum bunch I\u2019m worried about . . . can\u2019t you get a\u2014what is it, Heck?\u201d\u201cChange of venue,\u201d said Mr. Tate. \u201cNot much point in that, now is it?\u201dAtticus said something inaudible. I turned to Jem, who waved me to silence.\u201c\u2014besides,\u201d Atticus was saying, \u201cyou\u2019re not scared of that crowd, are you?\u201d\u201c. . . know how they do when they get shinnied up.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t usually drink on Sunday, they go to church most of the day . . .\u201d Atticus said.\u201cThis is a special occasion, though. . . .\u201d someone said.They murmured and buzzed until Aunty said if Jem didn\u2019t turn on the livingroom lights he would disgrace the family. Jem didn\u2019t hear her.\u201c\u2014don\u2019t see why you touched it in the first place,\u201d Mr. Link Deas was saying. \u201cYou\u2019ve got everything to lose from this, Atticus. I mean everything.\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201dThis was Atticus\u2019s dangerous question. \u201cDo you really think you want to move there, Scout?\u201d Bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men. \u201cDo you really think that, son? Then read this.\u201d Jem would struggle the rest of an evening through the speeches of Henry W. Grady.\u201cLink, that boy might go to the chair, but he\u2019s not going till the truth\u2019s told.\u201d Atticus\u2019s voice was even. \u201cAnd you know what the truth is.\u201dThere was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when Atticus moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him.Suddenly Jem screamed, \u201cAtticus, the telephone\u2019s ringing!\u201dThe men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every day: merchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was Mr. Avery.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWell, answer it, son,\u201d called Atticus.Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light in the livingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid mark of the screen on his nose.\u201cWhy on earth are you all sitting in the dark?\u201d he asked.Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I sometimes think Atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind The Mobile Register, The Birmingham News and The Montgomery Advertiser.\u201cThey were after you, weren\u2019t they?\u201d Jem went to him. \u201cThey wanted to get you, didn\u2019t they?\u201dAtticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. \u201cWhat have you been reading?\u201d he asked. Then he said gently, \u201cNo son, those were our friends.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a\u2014a gang?\u201d Jem was looking from the corners of his eyes.Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didn\u2019t make it. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have mobs and that nonsense in Maycomb. I\u2019ve never heard of a gang in Maycomb.\u201d\u201cKu Klux got after some Catholics one time.\u201d\u201cNever heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cyou\u2019re confusing that with something else. Way back about nineteen-twenty there was a Klan, but it was a political organization more than anything. Besides, they couldn\u2019t find anybody to scare. They paraded by Mr. Sam Levy\u2019s house one night, but Sam just stood on his porch and told \u2019em things had come to a pretty pass, he\u2019d sold \u2019em the very sheets on their backs. Sam made \u2019em so ashamed of themselves they went away.\u201dThe Levy family met all criteria for being Fine Folks: they did the best they could with the sense they had, and they had been living on the same plot of ground in Maycomb for five generations.\u201cThe Ku Klux\u2019s gone,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cIt\u2019ll never come back.\u201dI walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus saying to Aunty, \u201c. . . in favor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life,\u201d a pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussing again.I sought Jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought. \u201cHave they been at it?\u201d I asked.\u201cSort of. She won\u2019t let him alone about Tom Robinson. She almost said Atticus was disgracin\u2019 the family. Scout . . . I\u2019m scared.\u201d\u201cScared\u2019a what?\u201d\u201cScared about Atticus. Somebody might hurt him.\u201d Jem preferred to remain mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church when the congregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another knot of men. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered if he had seen the light. He never went to church. Even Mr. Underwood was there. Mr. Underwood had no use for any organization but The Maycomb Tribune, of which he was the sole owner, editor, and printer. His days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely gathered news; people brought it to him. It was said that he made up every edition of The Maycomb Tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype. This was believable. Something must have been up to haul Mr. Underwood out.I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that they\u2019d moved Tom Robinson to the Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to me, that if they\u2019d kept him there in the first place there wouldn\u2019t have been any fuss. I watched him take his seat on the third row from the front, and I heard him rumble, \u201cNearer my God to thee,\u201d some notes behind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me. He liked to be by himself in church.The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by Aunt Alexandra\u2019s presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where if we sometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading. Aunt Alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us to make any noise in the yard, the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our Sundays creeping around in Deer\u2019s Pasture.Shooting on Sundays was prohibited, so Dill and I kicked Jem\u2019s football around the pasture for a while, which was no fun. Dill asked if I\u2019d like to have a poke at Boo Radley. I said I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be nice to bother him, and spent the rest of the afternoon filling Dill in on last winter\u2019s events. He was considerably impressed.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "We parted at suppertime, and after our meal Jem and I were settling down to a routine evening, when Atticus did something that interested us: he came into the livingroom carrying a long electrical extension cord. There was a light bulb on the end.\u201cI\u2019m going out for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cYou folks\u2019ll be in bed when I come back, so I\u2019ll say good night now.\u201dWith that, he put his hat on and went out the back door.\u201cHe\u2019s takin\u2019 the car,\u201d said Jem.Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts; another was that he liked to walk. As far back as I could remember, there was always a Chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse, and Atticus put many miles on it in business trips, but in Maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day, covering about two miles. He said his only exercise was walking. In Maycomb, if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe one\u2019s mind incapable of definite purpose.Later on, I bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when I heard Jem rattling around in his room. His go-to-bed noises were so familiar to me that I knocked on his door: \u201cWhy ain\u2019t you going to bed?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 downtown for a while.\u201d He was changing his pants.\u201cWhy? It\u2019s almost ten o\u2019clock, Jem.\u201dHe knew it, but he was going anyway.\u201cThen I\u2019m goin\u2019 with you. If you say no you\u2019re not, I\u2019m goin\u2019 anyway, hear?\u201dJem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I suppose he thought a fight would antagonize Aunty, so he gave in with little grace.I dressed quickly. We waited until Aunty\u2019s light went out, and we walked quietly down the back steps. There was no moon tonight.\u201cDill\u2019ll wanta come,\u201d I whispered.\u201cSo he will,\u201d said Jem gloomily.We leaped over the driveway wall, cut through Miss Rachel\u2019s side yard and went to Dill\u2019s window. Jem whistled bob-white. Dill\u2019s face appeared at the screen, disappeared, and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out. An old campaigner, he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cJem\u2019s got the look-arounds,\u201d an affliction Calpurnia said all boys caught at his age.\u201cI\u2019ve just got this feeling,\u201d Jem said, \u201cjust this feeling.\u201dWe went by Mrs. Dubose\u2019s house, standing empty and shuttered, her camellias grown up in weeds and johnson grass. There were eight more houses to the post office corner.The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle bushes bristled each corner, and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street lights. A light shone in the county toilet, otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark. A larger square of stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights burned from deep within them.Atticus\u2019s office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice, but after several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the Maycomb Bank building. When we rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the bank. \u201cHe\u2019s in there,\u201d said Jem.But he wasn\u2019t. His office was reached by a long hallway. Looking down the hall, we should have seen Atticus Finch, Attorney-at-Law in small sober letters against the light from behind his door. It was dark.Jem peered in the bank door to make sure. He turned the knob. The door was locked. \u201cLet\u2019s go up the street. Maybe he\u2019s visitin\u2019 Mr. Underwood.\u201dMr. Underwood not only ran The Maycomb Tribune office, he lived in it. That is, above it. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairs window. The office building was on the northwest corner of the square, and to reach it we had to pass the jail.The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county\u2019s buildings. Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair might have designed. It was certainly someone\u2019s dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores and steep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide and two cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndal\u2019s Hardware Store and The Maycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycomb\u2019s only conversation piece: its detractors said it looked like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "As we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the distance. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d said Jem, \u201cjail doesn\u2019t have an outside light.\u201d\u201cLooks like it\u2019s over the door,\u201d said Dill.A long extension cord ran between the bars of a second-floor window and down the side of the building. In the light from its bare bulb, Atticus was sitting propped against the front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was reading, oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over his head.I made to run, but Jem caught me. \u201cDon\u2019t go to him,\u201d he said, \u201che might not like it. He\u2019s all right, let\u2019s go home. I just wanted to see where he was.\u201dWe were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from the Meridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went around the square, passed the bank building, and stopped in front of the jail.Nobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed it, folded it deliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to the back of his head. He seemed to be expecting them.\u201cCome on,\u201d whispered Jem. We streaked across the square, across the street, until we were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem peeked up the sidewalk. \u201cWe can get closer,\u201d he said. We ran to Tyndal\u2019s Hardware door\u2014near enough, at the same time discreet.In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as light revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus remained where he was. The men hid him from view.\u201cHe in there, Mr. Finch?\u201d a man said.\u201cHe is,\u201d we heard Atticus answer, \u201cand he\u2019s asleep. Don\u2019t wake him up.\u201dIn obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in near-whispers.\u201cYou know what we want,\u201d another man said. \u201cGet aside from the door, Mr. Finch.\u201d\u201cYou can turn around and go home again, Walter,\u201d Atticus said pleasantly. \u201cHeck Tate\u2019s around somewhere.\u201d\u201cThe hell he is,\u201d said another man. \u201cHeck\u2019s bunch\u2019s so deep in the woods they won\u2019t get out till mornin\u2019.\u201d\u201cIndeed? Why so?\u201d\u201cCalled \u2019em off on a snipe hunt,\u201d was the succinct answer. \u201cDidn\u2019t you think a\u2019that, Mr. Finch?\u201d\u201cThought about it, but didn\u2019t believe it. Well then,\u201d my father\u2019s voice was still the same, \u201cthat changes things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt do,\u201d another deep voice said. Its owner was a shadow.\u201cDo you really think so?\u201dThis was the second time I heard Atticus ask that question in two days, and it meant somebody\u2019s man would get jumped. This was too good to miss. I broke away from Jem and ran as fast as I could to Atticus.Jem shrieked and tried to catch me, but I had a lead on him and Dill. I pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light.\u201cH-ey, Atticus!\u201dI thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of plain fear was going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into the light.There was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about, and when I glanced around I discovered that these men were strangers. They were not the people I saw last night. Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people I had never seen before.Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put the newspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers. They were trembling a little.\u201cGo home, Jem,\u201d he said. \u201cTake Scout and Dill home.\u201dWe were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticus\u2019s instructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging.\u201cGo home, I said.\u201dJem shook his head. As Atticus\u2019s fists went to his hips, so did Jem\u2019s, and as they faced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jem\u2019s soft brown hair and eyes, his oval face and snugfitting ears were our mother\u2019s contrasting oddly with Atticus\u2019s graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were somehow alike. Mutual defiance made them alike.\u201cSon, I said go home.\u201dJem shook his head.\u201cI\u2019ll send him home,\u201d a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar. He yanked Jem nearly off his feet.\u201cDon\u2019t you touch him!\u201d I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to see him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019ll do, Scout.\u201d Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t kick folks. No\u2014\u201d he said, as I was pleading justification.\u201cAin\u2019t nobody gonna do Jem that way,\u201d I said.\u201cAll right, Mr. Finch, get \u2019em outa here,\u201d someone growled. \u201cYou got fifteen seconds to get \u2019em outa here.\u201dIn the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him. \u201cI ain\u2019t going,\u201d was his steady answer to Atticus\u2019s threats, requests, and finally, \u201cPlease Jem, take them home.\u201cI was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons for doing as he did, in view of his prospects once Atticus did get him home. I looked around the crowd. It was a summer\u2019s night, but the men were dressed, most of them, in overalls and denim shirts buttoned up to the collars. I thought they must be cold-natured, as their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore hats pulled firmly down over their ears. They were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men who seemed unused to late hours. I sought once more for a familiar face, and at the center of the semi-circle I found one.\u201cHey, Mr. Cunningham.\u201dThe man did not hear me, it seemed.\u201cHey, Mr. Cunningham. How\u2019s your entailment gettin\u2019 along?\u201dMr. Walter Cunningham\u2019s legal affaris were well known to me; Atticus had once described them at length. The big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his overall straps. He seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his throat and looked away. My friendly overture had fallen flat.Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was white in contrast to his sunscorched face, which led me to believe that he wore one most days. He shifted his feet, clad in heavy work shoes.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I\u2019m Jean Louise Finch. You brought us some hickory nuts one time, remember?\u201d I began to sense the futility one feels when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance.\u201cI go to school with Walter,\u201d I began again. \u201cHe\u2019s your boy, ain\u2019t he? Ain\u2019t he, sir?\u201dMr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after all.\u201cHe\u2019s in my grade,\u201d I said, \u201cand he does right well. He\u2019s a good boy,\u201d I added, \u201ca real nice boy. We brought him home for dinner one time. Maybe he told you about me, I beat him up one time but he was real nice about it. Tell him hey for me, won\u2019t you?\u201dAtticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in, not about what you were interested in. Mr. Cunningham displayed no interest in his son, so I tackled his entailment once more in a last-ditch effort to make him feel at home.\u201cEntailments are bad,\u201d I was advising him, when I slowly awoke to the fact that I was addressing the entire aggregation. The men were all looking at me, some had their mouths half-open. Atticus had stopped poking at Jem: they were standing together beside Dill. Their attention amounted to fascination. Atticus\u2019s mouth, even, was half-open, an attitude he had once described as uncouth. Our eyes met and he shut it.\u201cWell, Atticus, I was just sayin\u2019 to Mr. Cunningham that entailments are bad an\u2019 all that, but you said not to worry, it take a long time sometimes . . . that you all\u2019d ride it out together . . .\u201d I was slowly drying up, wondering what idiocy I had committed. Entailments seemed all right enough for livingroom talk.I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair; I could stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me. They were quite still.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked.Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose face was equally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted down and took me by both shoulders.\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you said hey, little lady,\u201d he said.They he straightened up and waved a big paw. \u201cLet\u2019s clear out,\u201d he called. \u201cLet\u2019s get going, boys.\u201dAs they had come, in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle cars. Doors slammed, engines coughed, and they were gone.I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with his face to the wall. I went to him and pulled his sleeve. \u201cCan we go home now?\u201d He nodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going over and blew his nose violently.\u201cMr. Finch?\u201dA soft husky voice came from the darkness above: \u201cThey gone?\u201dAtticus stepped back and looked up. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone,\u201d he said. \u201cGet some sleep, Tom. They won\u2019t bother you any more.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "From a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the night: \u201cYou\u2019re damn tootin\u2019 they won\u2019t. Had you covered all the time, Atticus.\u201dMr. Underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his window above The Maycomb Tribune office.It was long past my bedtime and I was growing quite tired; it seemed that Atticus and Mr. Underwood would talk for the rest of the night, Mr. Underwood out the window and Atticus up at him. Finally Atticus returned, switched off the light above the jail door, and picked up his chair.\u201cCan I carry it for you, Mr. Finch?\u201d asked Dill. He had not said a word the whole time.\u201cWhy, thank you, son.\u201dWalking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind Atticus and Jem. Dill was encumbered by the chair, and his pace was slower. Atticus and Jem were well ahead of us, and I assumed that Atticus was giving him hell for not going home, but I was wrong. As they passed under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and massaged Jem\u2019s hair, his one gesture of affection.16Jem heard me. He thrust his head around the connecting door. As he came to my bed Atticus\u2019s light flashed on. We stayed where we were until it went off; we heard him turn over, and we waited until he was still again.Jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him. \u201cTry to go to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all over after tomorrow, maybe.\u201dWe had come in quietly, so as not to wake Aunty. Atticus killed the engine in the driveway and coasted to the carhouse; we went in the back door and to our rooms without a word. I was very tired, and was drifting into sleep when the memory of Atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became Atticus standing in the middle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. The full meaning of the night\u2019s events hit me and I began crying. Jem was awfully nice about it: for once he didn\u2019t remind me that people nearly nine years old didn\u2019t do things like that.Everybody\u2019s appetite was delicate this morning, except Jem\u2019s; he ate his way through three eggs. Atticus watched in frank admiration; Aunt Alexandra sipped coffee and radiated waves of disapproval. Children who slipped out at night were a disgrace to the family. Atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along, but Aunty said, \u201cNonsense, Mr. Underwood was there all the time.\u201d\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a funny thing about Braxton,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cHe despises Negroes, won\u2019t have one near him.\u201dLocal opinion held Mr. Underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose father in a fey fit of humor christened Braxton Bragg, a name Mr. Underwood had done his best to live down. Atticus said naming people after Confederate generals made slow steady drinkers.Calpurnia was serving Aunt Alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at what I thought was a pleading winning look. \u201cYou\u2019re still too little,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when you ain\u2019t.\u201d I said it might help my stomach. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and got a cup from the sideboard. She poured one tablespoon of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk. I thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it, and looked up to catch Aunty\u2019s warning frown. But she was frowning at Atticus.She waited until Calpurnia was in the kitchen, then she said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that in front of them.\u201d\u201cTalk like what in front of whom?\u201d he asked.\u201cLike that in front of Calpurnia. You said Braxton Underwood despises Negroes right in front of her.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure Cal knows it. Everybody in Maycomb knows it.\u201dI was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out when he talked with Aunt Alexandra. It was a quiet digging in, never outright irritation. There was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, \u201cAnything fit to say at the table\u2019s fit to say in front of Calpurnia. She knows what she means to this family.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good habit, Atticus. It encourages them. You know how they talk among themselves. Everything that happens in this town\u2019s out to the Quarters before sundown.\u201dMy father put down his knife. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any law that says they can\u2019t talk. Maybe if we didn\u2019t give them so much to talk about they\u2019d be quiet. Why don\u2019t you drink your coffee, Scout?\u201dI was playing in it with the spoon. \u201cI thought Mr. Cunningham was a friend of ours. You told me a long time ago he was.\u201d\u201cHe still is.\u201d\u201cBut last night he wanted to hurt you.\u201dAtticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside. \u201cMr. Cunningham\u2019s basically a good man,\u201d he said, \u201che just has his blind spots along with the rest of us.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t call that a blind spot. He\u2019da killed you last night when he first went there.\u201d\u201cHe might have hurt me a little,\u201d Atticus conceded, \u201cbut son, you\u2019ll understand folks a little better when you\u2019re older. A mob\u2019s always made up of people, no matter what. Mr. Cunningham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man. Every mob in every little Southern town is always made up of people you know\u2014doesn\u2019t say much for them, does it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say not,\u201d said Jem.\u201cSo it took an eight-year-old child to bring \u2019em to their senses, didn\u2019t it?\u201d said Atticus. \u201cThat proves something\u2014that a gang of wild animals can be stopped, simply because they\u2019re still human. Hmp, maybe we need a police force of children . . . you children last night made Walter Cunningham stand in my shoes for a minute. That was enough.\u201dWell, I hoped Jem would understand folks a little better when he was older; I wouldn\u2019t. \u201cFirst day Walter comes back to school\u2019ll be his last,\u201d I affirmed.\u201cYou will not touch him,\u201d Atticus said flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t want either of you bearing a grudge about this thing, no matter what happens.\u201d\u201cYou see, don\u2019t you,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra, \u201cwhat comes of things like this. Don\u2019t say I haven\u2019t told you.\u201dAtticus said he\u2019d never say that, pushed out his chair and got up. \u201cThere\u2019s a day ahead, so excuse me. Jem, I don\u2019t want you and Scout downtown today, please.\u201dAs Atticus departed, Dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom. \u201cIt\u2019s all over town this morning,\u201d he announced, \u201call about how we held off a hundred folks with our bare hands. . . .\u201dAunt Alexandra stared him to silence. \u201cIt was not a hundred folks,\u201d she said, \u201cand nobody held anybody off. It was just a nest of those Cunninghams, drunk and disorderly.\u201d\u201cAw, Aunty, that\u2019s just Dill\u2019s way,\u201d said Jem. He signaled us to follow him.\u201cYou all stay in the yard today,\u201d she said, as we made our way to the front porch.It was like Saturday. People from the south end of the county passed our house in a leisurely but steady stream.Mr. Dolphus Raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred. \u201cDon\u2019t see how he stays in the saddle,\u201d murmured Jem. \u201cHow c\u2019n you stand to get drunk \u2019fore eight in the morning?\u201dA wagonload of ladies rattled past us. They wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses with long sleeves. A bearded man in a wool hat drove them. \u201cYonder\u2019s some Mennonites,\u201d Jem said to Dill. \u201cThey don\u2019t have buttons.\u201d They lived deep in the woods, did most of their trading across the river, and rarely came to Maycomb. Dill was interested. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got blue eyes,\u201d Jem explained, \u201cand the men can\u2019t shave after they marry. Their wives like for \u2019em to tickle \u2019em with their beards.\u201dMr. X Billups rode by on a mule and waved to us. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny man,\u201d said Jem. \u201cX\u2019s his name, not his initial. He was in court one time and they asked him his name. He said X Billups. Clerk asked him to spell it and he said X. Asked him again and he said X. They kept at it till he wrote X on a sheet of paper and held it up for everybody to see. They asked him where he got his name and he said that\u2019s the way his folks signed him up when he was born.\u201dAs the county went by us, Jem gave Dill the histories and general attitudes of the more prominent figures: Mr. Tensaw Jones voted the straight Prohibition ticket; Miss Emily Davis dipped snuff in private; Mr. Byron Waller could play the violin; Mr. Jake Slade was cutting his third set of teeth.A wagonload of unusually stern-faced citizens appeared. When they pointed to Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s yard, ablaze with summer flowers, Miss Maudie herself came out on the porch. There was an odd thing about Miss Maudie\u2014on her porch she was too far away for us to see her features clearly, but we could always catch her mood by the way she stood. She was now standing arms akimbo, her shoulders dropping a little, her head cocked to one side, her glasses winking in the sunlight. We knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness.The driver of the wagon slowed down his mules, and a shrill-voiced woman called out: \u201cHe that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness!\u201dMiss Maudie answered: \u201cA merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance!\u201dI guessed that the foot-washers thought that the Devil was quoting Scripture for his own purposes, as the driver speeded his mules. Why they objected to Miss Maudie\u2019s yard was a mystery, heightened in my mind because for someone who spent all the daylight hours outdoors, Miss Maudie\u2019s command of Scripture was formidable.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cYou goin\u2019 to court this morning?\u201d asked Jem. We had strolled over.\u201cI am not,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no business with the court this morning.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you goin\u2019 down to watch?\u201d asked Dill.\u201cI am not. \u2019t\u2019s morbid, watching a poor devil on trial for his life. Look at all those folks, it\u2019s like a Roman carnival.\u201d\u201cThey hafta try him in public, Miss Maudie,\u201d I said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be right if they didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite aware of that,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because it\u2019s public, I don\u2019t have to go, do I?\u201dMiss Stephanie Crawford came by. She wore a hat and gloves. \u201cUm, um, um,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at all those folks\u2014you\u2019d think William Jennings Bryan was speakin\u2019.\u201d\u201cAnd where are you going, Stephanie?\u201d inquired Miss Maudie.\u201cTo the Jitney Jungle.\u201dMiss Maudie said she\u2019d never seen Miss Stephanie go to the Jitney Jungle in a hat in her life.\u201cWell,\u201d said Miss Stephanie, \u201cI thought I might just look in at the courthouse, to see what Atticus\u2019s up to.\u201d\u201cBetter be careful he doesn\u2019t hand you a subpoena.\u201dWe asked Miss Maudie to elucidate: she said Miss Stephanie seemed to know so much about the case she might as well be called on to testify.We held off until noon, when Atticus came home to dinner and said they\u2019d spent the morning picking the jury. After dinner, we stopped by for Dill and went to town.It was a gala occasion. There was no room at the public hitching rail for another animal, mules and wagons were parked under every available tree. The courthouse square was covered with picnic parties sitting on newspapers, washing down biscuit and syrup with warm milk from fruit jars. Some people were gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chops. The more affluent chased their food with drugstore Coca-Cola in bulb-shaped soda glasses. Greasy-faced children popped-the-whip through the crowd, and babies lunched at their mothers\u2019 breasts.In a far corner of the square, the Negroes sat quietly in the sun, dining on sardines, crackers, and the more vivid flavors of Nehi Cola. Mr. Dolphus Raymond sat with them.\u201cJem,\u201d said Dill, \u201che\u2019s drinkin\u2019 out of a sack.\u201dMr. Dolphus Raymond seemed to be so doing: two yellow drugstore straws ran from his mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag.\u201cAin\u2019t ever seen anybody do that,\u201d murmured Dill. \u201cHow does he keep what\u2019s in it in it?\u201dJem giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s got a Co-Cola bottle full of whiskey in there. That\u2019s so\u2019s not to upset the ladies. You\u2019ll see him sip it all afternoon, he\u2019ll step out for a while and fill it back up.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019s he sittin\u2019 with the colored folks?\u201d\u201cAlways does. He likes \u2019em better\u2019n he likes us, I reckon. Lives by himself way down near the county line. He\u2019s got a colored woman and all sorts of mixed chillun. Show you some of \u2019em if we see \u2019em.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like trash,\u201d said Dill.\u201cHe\u2019s not, he owns all one side of the riverbank down there, and he\u2019s from a real old family to boot.\u201d\u201cThen why does he do like that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just his way,\u201d said Jem. \u201cThey say he never got over his weddin\u2019. He was supposed to marry one of the\u2014the Spender ladies, I think. They were gonna have a huge weddin\u2019, but they didn\u2019t\u2014after the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew her head off. Shotgun. She pulled the trigger with her toes.\u201d\u201cDid they ever know why?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Jem, \u201cnobody ever knew quite why but Mr. Dolphus. They said it was because she found out about his colored woman, he reckoned he could keep her and get married too. He\u2019s been sorta drunk ever since. You know, though, he\u2019s real good to those chillun\u2014\u201d\u201cJem,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s a mixed child?\u201d\u201cHalf white, half colored. You\u2019ve seen \u2019em, Scout. You know that red-kinky-headed one that delivers for the drugstore. He\u2019s half white. They\u2019re real sad.\u201d\u201cSad, how come?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t belong anywhere. Colored folks won\u2019t have \u2019em because they\u2019re half white; white folks won\u2019t have \u2019em \u2019cause they\u2019re colored, so they\u2019re just in-betweens, don\u2019t belong anywhere. But Mr. Dolphus, now, they say he\u2019s shipped two of his up north. They don\u2019t mind \u2019em up north. Yonder\u2019s one of \u2019em.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "A small boy clutching a Negro woman\u2019s hand walked toward us. He looked all Negro to me; he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth.

Hey, look\u2014\u201dSome invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits of newspaper, cellophane, and wrapping paper. Children came to mothers, babies were cradled on hips as men in sweat-stained hats collected their families and herded them through the courthouse doors. In the far corner of the square the Negroes and Mr. Dolphus Raymond stood up and dusted their breeches. There were few women and children among them, which seemed to dispel the holiday mood. They waited patiently at the doors behind the white families.\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d said Dill.\u201cNaw, we better wait till they get in, Atticus might not like it if he sees us,\u201d said Jem.The Maycomb County courthouse was faintly reminiscent of Arlington in one respect: the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light burden. The pillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in 1856. Another courthouse was built around them. It is better to say, built in spite of them. But for the south porch, the Maycomb County courthouse was early Victorian, presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north. From the other side, however, Greek revival columns clashed with a big nineteenth-century clock tower housing a rusty unreliable instrument, a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past.To reach the courtroom, on the second floor, one passed sundry sunless county cubbyholes: the tax assessor, the tax collector, the county clerk, the county solicitor, the circuit clerk, the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that smelled of decaying record books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine. It was necessary to turn on the lights in the daytime; there was always a film of dust on the rough floorboards. The inhabitants of these offices were creatures of their environment: little gray-faced men, they seemed untouched by wind or sun.We knew there was a crowd, but we had not bargained for the multitudes in the first-floor hallway. I got separated from Jem and Dill, but made my way toward the wall by the stairwell, knowing Jem would come for me eventually. I found myself in the middle of the Idlers\u2019 Club and made myself as unobtrusive as possible. This was a group of white-shirted, khaki-trousered, suspendered old men who had spent their lives doing nothing and passed their twilight days doing same on pine benches under the live oaks on the square. Attentive critics of courthouse business, Atticus said they knew as much law as the Chief Justice, from long years of observation. Normally, they were the court\u2019s only spectators, and today they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine. When they spoke, their voices sounded casually important. The conversation was about my father.\u201c. . . thinks he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d one said.\u201cOh-h now, I wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d said another. \u201cAtticus Finch\u2019s a deep reader, a mighty deep reader.\u201d\u201cHe reads all right, that\u2019s all he does.\u201d The club snickered.\u201cLemme tell you somethin\u2019 now, Billy,\u201d a third said, \u201cyou know the court appointed him to defend this nigger.\u201d\u201cYeah, but Atticus aims to defend him. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about it.\u201dThis was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus had to, whether he wanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadn\u2019t said anything to us about it\u2014we could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to, that\u2019s why he was doing it, equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the town\u2019s attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed to defend him. That\u2019s what they didn\u2019t like about it. It was confusing.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "The Negroes, having waited for the white people to go upstairs, began to come in. \u201cWhoa now, just a minute,\u201d said a club member, holding up his walking stick. \u201cJust don\u2019t start up them there stairs yet awhile.\u201dThe club began its stiff-jointed climb and ran into Dill and Jem on their way down looking for me. They squeezed past and Jem called, \u201cScout, come on, there ain\u2019t a seat left. We\u2019ll hafta stand up.\u201d\u201cLooka there, now,\u201d he said irritably, as the black people surged upstairs. The old men ahead of them would take most of the standing room. We were out of luck and it was all my fault, Jem informed me. We stood miserably by the wall.\u201cCan\u2019t you all get in?\u201dReverend Sykes was looking down at us, black hat in hand.\u201cHey, Reverend,\u201d said Jem. \u201cNaw, Scout here messed us up.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201dReverend Sykes edged his way upstairs. In a few moments he was back. \u201cThere\u2019s not a seat downstairs. Do you all reckon it\u2019ll be all right if you all came to the balcony with me?\u201d\u201cGosh yes,\u201d said Jem. Happily, we sped ahead of Reverend Sykes to the courtroom floor. There, we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door. Reverend Sykes came puffing behind us, and steered us gently through the black people in the balcony. Four Negroes rose and gave us their front-row seats.The Colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a second-story veranda, and from it we could see everything.The jury sat to the left, under long windows. Sunburned, lanky, they seemed to be all farmers, but this was natural: townsfolk rarely sat on juries, they were either struck or excused. One or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressed-up Cunninghams. At this stage they sat straight and alert.The circuit solicitor and another man, Atticus and Tom Robinson sat at tables with their backs to us. There was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the solicitor\u2019s table; Atticus\u2019s was bare.Just inside the railing that divided the spectators from the court, the witnesses sat on cowhide-bottomed chairs. Their backs were to us.Judge Taylor was on the bench, looking like a sleepy old shark, his pilot fish writing rapidly below in front of him. Judge Taylor looked like most judges I had ever seen: amiable, white-haired, slightly ruddy-faced, he was a man who ran his court with an alarming informality\u2014he sometimes propped his feet up, he often cleaned his fingernails with his pocket knife. In long equity hearings, especially after dinner, he gave the impression of dozing, an impression dispelled forever when a lawyer once deliberately pushed a pile of books to the floor in a desperate effort to wake him up. Without opening his eyes, Judge Taylor murmured, \u201cMr. Whitley, do that again and it\u2019ll cost you one hundred dollars.\u201dHe was a man learned in the law, and although he seemed to take his job casually, in reality he kept a firm grip on any proceedings that came before him. Only once was Judge Taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court, and the Cunninghams stopped him. Old Sarum, their stamping grounds, was populated by two families separate and apart in the beginning, but unfortunately bearing the same name. The Cunninghams married the Coninghams until the spelling of the names was academic\u2014academic until a Cunningham disputed a Coningham over land titles and took to the law. During a controversy of this character, Jeems Cunningham testified that his mother spelled it Cunningham on deeds and things, but she was really a Coningham, she was an uncertain speller, a seldom reader, and was given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front gallery in the evening. After nine hours of listening to the eccentricities of Old Sarum\u2019s inhabitants, Judge Taylor threw the case out of court. When asked upon what grounds, Judge Taylor said, \u201cChampertous connivance,\u201d and declared he hoped to God the litigants were satisfied by each having had their public say. They were. That was all they had wanted in the first place.Judge Taylor had one interesting habit. He permitted smoking in his courtroom but did not himself indulge: sometimes, if one was lucky, one had the privilege of watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up. Bit by bit the dead cigar would disappear, to reappear some hours later as a flat slick mess, its essence extracted and mingling with Judge Taylor\u2019s digestive juices. I once asked Atticus how Mrs. Taylor stood to kiss him, but Atticus said they didn\u2019t kiss much.The witness stand was to the right of Judge Taylor, and when we got to our seats Mr. Heck Tate was already on it.17\u201cJem,\u201d I said, \u201care those the Ewells sittin\u2019 down yonder?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cHush,\u201d said Jem, \u201cMr. Heck Tate\u2019s testifyin\u2019.\u201dMr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary business suit, which made him look somehow like every other man: gone were his high boots, lumber jacket, and bullet-studded belt. From that moment he ceased to terrify me. He was sitting forward in the witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees, listening attentively to the circuit solicitor.The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from Abbottsville; we saw him only when court convened, and that rarely, for court was of no special interest to Jem and me. A balding, smooth-faced man, he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty. Although his back was to us, we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eyes which he used to his advantage: he seemed to be looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was hell on juries and witnesses. The jury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny, paid attention; so did the witnesses, thinking likewise.\u201c. . . in your own words, Mr. Tate,\u201d Mr. Gilmer was saying.\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Tate, touching his glasses and speaking to his knees, \u201cI was called\u2014\u201d\u201cCould you say it to the jury, Mr. Tate? Thank you. Who called you?\u201dMr. Tate said, \u201cI was fetched by Bob\u2014by Mr. Bob Ewell yonder, one night\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat night, sir?\u201dMr. Tate said, \u201cIt was the night of November twenty-first. I was just leaving my office to go home when B\u2014Mr. Ewell came in, very excited he was, and said get out to his house quick, some nigger\u2019d raped his girl.\u201d\u201cDid you go?\u201d\u201cCertainly. Got in the car and went out as fast as I could.\u201d\u201cAnd what did you find?\u201d\u201cFound her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room, one on the right as you go in. She was pretty well beat up, but I heaved her to her feet and she washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she was all right. I asked her who hurt her and she said it was Tom Robinson\u2014\u201dJudge Taylor, who had been concentrating on his fingernails, looked up as if he were expecting an objection, but Atticus was quiet.\u201c\u2014asked her if he beat her like that, she said yes he had. Asked her if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did. So I went down to Robinson\u2019s house and brought him back. She identified him as the one, so I took him in. That\u2019s all there was to it.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d said Mr. Gilmer.Judge Taylor said, \u201cAny questions, Atticus?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said my father. He was sitting behind his table; his chair was skewed to one side, his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the back of his chair.\u201cDid you call a doctor, Sheriff? Did anybody call a doctor?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cNo sir,\u201d said Mr. Tate.\u201cDidn\u2019t call a doctor?\u201d\u201cNo sir,\u201d repeated Mr. Tate.\u201cWhy not?\u201d There was an edge to Atticus\u2019s voice.\u201cWell I can tell you why I didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t necessary, Mr. Finch. She was mighty banged up. Something sho\u2019 happened, it was obvious.\u201d\u201cBut you didn\u2019t call a doctor? While you were there did anyone send for one, fetch one, carry her to one?\u201d\u201cNo sir\u2014\u201dJudge Taylor broke in. \u201cHe\u2019s answered the question three times, Atticus. He didn\u2019t call a doctor.\u201dAtticus said, \u201cI just wanted to make sure, Judge,\u201d and the judge smiled.Jem\u2019s hand, which was resting on the balcony rail, tightened around it. He drew in his breath suddenly. Glancing below, I saw no corresponding reaction, and wondered if Jem was trying to be dramatic. Dill was watching peacefully, and so was Reverend Sykes beside him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I whispered, and got a terse, \u201cSh-h!\u201d\u201cSheriff,\u201d Atticus was saying, \u201cyou say she was mighty banged up. In what way?\u201d\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\u201cJust describe her injuries, Heck.\u201d\u201cWell, she was beaten around the head. There was already bruises comin\u2019 on her arms, and it happened about thirty minutes before\u2014\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201dMr. Tate grinned. \u201cSorry, that\u2019s what they said. Anyway, she was pretty bruised up when I got there, and she had a black eye comin\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhich eye?\u201dMr. Tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said softly, then he looked at Atticus as if he considered the question childish. \u201cCan\u2019t you remember?\u201d Atticus asked.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Mr. Tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him and said, \u201cHer left.\u201d\u201cWait a minute, Sheriff,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cWas it her left facing you or her left looking the same way you were?\u201dMr. Tate said, \u201cOh yes, that\u2019d make it her right. It was her right eye, Mr. Finch. I remember now, she was bunged up on that side of her face. . . .\u201dMr. Tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain to him. Then he turned his head and looked around at Tom Robinson. As if by instinct, Tom Robinson raised his head.Something had been made plain to Atticus also, and it brought him to his feet. \u201cSheriff, please repeat what you said.\u201d\u201cIt was her right eye, I said.\u201d\u201cNo . . .\u201d Atticus walked to the court reporter\u2019s desk and bent down to the furiously scribbling hand. It stopped, flipped back the shorthand pad, and the court reporter said, \u201c \u2018Mr. Finch. I remember now she was bunged up on that side of the face.\u2019 \u201dAtticus looked up at Mr. Tate. \u201cWhich side again, Heck?\u201d\u201cThe right side, Mr. Finch, but she had more bruises\u2014you wanta hear about \u2019em?\u201dAtticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought better of it and said, \u201cYes, what were her other injuries?\u201d As Mr. Tate answered, Atticus turned and looked at Tom Robinson as if to say this was something they hadn\u2019t bargained for.\u201c. . . her arms were bruised, and she showed me her neck. There were definite finger marks on her gullet\u2014\u201d\u201cAll around her throat? At the back of her neck?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d say they were all around, Mr. Finch.\u201d\u201cYou would?\u201d\u201cYes sir, she had a small throat, anybody could\u2019a reached around it with\u2014\u201d\u201cJust answer the question yes or no, please, Sheriff,\u201d said Atticus dryly, and Mr. Tate fell silent.Atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor, who shook his head at the judge, who nodded to Mr. Tate, who rose stiffly and stepped down from the witness stand.Below us, heads turned, feet scraped the floor, babies were shifted to shoulders, and a few children scampered out of the courtroom. The Negroes behind us whispered softly among themselves; Dill was asking Reverend Sykes what it was all about, but Reverend Sykes said he didn\u2019t know. So far, things were utterly dull: nobody had thundered, there were no arguments between opposing counsel, there was no drama; a grave disappointment to all present, it seemed. Atticus was proceeding amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute. With his infinite capacity for calming turbulent seas, he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon. Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells, of sleepy-eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the night, \u201cMr. Finch? They gone?\u201d Our nightmare had gone with daylight, everything would come out all right.All the spectators were as relaxed as Judge Taylor, except Jem. His mouth was twisted into a purposeful half-grin, and his eyes happy about, and he said something about corroborating evidence, which made me sure he was showing off.\u201c. . . Robert E. Lee Ewell!\u201dIn answer to the clerk\u2019s booming voice, a little bantam cock of a man rose and strutted to the stand, the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name. When he turned around to take the oath, we saw that his face was as red as his neck. We also saw no resemblance to his namesake. A shock of wispy new-washed hair stood up from his forehead; his nose was thin, pointed, and shiny; he had no chin to speak of\u2014it seemed to be a part of his crepey neck.\u201c\u2014so help me God,\u201d he crowed.Every town the size of Maycomb had families like the Ewells. No economic fluctuations changed their status\u2014people like the Ewells lived as guests of the county in prosperity as well as in the depths of a depression. No truant officers could keep their numerous offspring in school; no public health officer could free them from congenital defects, various worms, and the diseases indigenous to filthy surroundings.Maycomb\u2019s Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a Negro cabin. The cabin\u2019s plank walls were supplemented with sheets of corrugated iron, its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat, so only its general shape suggested its original design: square, with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall, the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone. Its windows were merely open spaces in the walls, which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on Maycomb\u2019s refuse.The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day, and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten) made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child: what passed for a fence was bits of tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty hammerheads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire. Enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing the remains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks), a discarded dentist\u2019s chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: old shoes, worn-out table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, under which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "One corner of the yard, though, bewildered Maycomb. Against the fence, in a line, were six chipped-enamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums, cared for as tenderly as if they belonged to Miss Maudie Atkinson, had Miss Maudie deigned to permit a geranium on her premises. People said they were Mayella Ewell\u2019s.Nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. Some people said six, others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced ones at the windows when anyone passed by. Nobody had occasion to pass by except at Christmas, when the churches delivered baskets, and when the mayor of Maycomb asked us to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash.Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the mayor\u2019s request. A dirt road ran from the highway past the dump, down to a small Negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the Ewells\u2019. It was necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around; most people turned around in the Negroes\u2019 front yards. In the frosty December dusk, their cabins looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing amber from the fires inside. There were delicious smells about: chicken, bacon frying crisp as the twilight air. Jem and I detected squirrel cooking, but it took an old countryman like Atticus to identify possum and rabbit, aromas that vanished when we rode back past the Ewell residence.All the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearest neighbors was, that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water, his skin was white.\u201cMr. Robert Ewell?\u201d asked Mr. Gilmer.\u201cThat\u2019s m\u2019name, cap\u2019n,\u201d said the witness.Mr. Gilmer\u2019s back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him. Perhaps I\u2019d better explain something now. I\u2019ve heard that lawyers\u2019 children, on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument, get the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemies of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised to see them often go out arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the first recess. This was not true of Jem and me. We acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose. I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t provide any drama in this respect; if I did, it would not be true. We could tell, however, when debate became more acrimonious than professional, but this was from watching lawyers other than our father. I never heard Atticus raise his voice in my life, except to a deaf witness. Mr. Gilmer was doing his job, as Atticus was doing his. Besides, Mr. Ewell was Mr. Gilmer\u2019s witness, and he had no business being rude to him of all people.\u201cAre you the father of Mayella Ewell?\u201d was the next question.\u201cWell, if I ain\u2019t I can\u2019t do nothing about it now, her ma\u2019s dead,\u201d was the answer.Judge Taylor stirred. He turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at the witness. \u201cAre you the father of Mayella Ewell?\u201d he asked, in a way that made the laughter below us stop suddenly.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Ewell said meekly.Judge Taylor went on in tones of good will: \u201cThis the first time you\u2019ve ever been in court? I don\u2019t recall ever seeing you here.\u201d At the witness\u2019s affirmative nod he continued, \u201cWell, let\u2019s get something straight. There will be no more audibly obscene speculations on any subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as I\u2019m sitting here. Do you understand?\u201dMr. Ewell nodded, but I don\u2019t think he did. Judge Taylor sighed and said, \u201cAll right, Mr. Gilmer?\u201d\u201cThank you, sir. Mr. Ewell, would you tell us in your own words what happened on the evening of November twenty-first, please?\u201dJem grinned and pushed his hair back. Just-in-your-own words was Mr. Gilmer\u2019s trademark. We often wondered who else\u2019s words Mr. Gilmer was afraid his witness might employ.\u201cWell, the night of November twenty-one I was comin\u2019 in from the woods with a load o\u2019kindlin\u2019 and just as I got to the fence I heard Mayella screamin\u2019 like a stuck hog inside the house\u2014\u201dHere Judge Taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided his speculations devoid of evil intent, for he subsided sleepily.\u201cWhat time was it, Mr. Ewell?\u201d\u201cJust \u2019fore sundown. Well, I was sayin\u2019 Mayella was screamin\u2019 fit to beat Jesus\u2014\u201d another glance from the bench silenced Mr. Ewell.\u201cYes? She was screaming?\u201d said Mr. Gilmer.Mr. Ewell looked confusedly at the judge. \u201cWell, Mayella was raisin\u2019 this holy racket so I dropped m\u2019load and run as fast as I could but I run into th\u2019 fence, but when I got distangled I run up to th\u2019 window and I seen\u2014\u201d Mr. Ewell\u2019s face grew scarlet. He stood up and pointed his finger at Tom Robinson. \u201c\u2014I seen that black nigger yonder ruttin\u2019 on my Mayella!\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "So serene was Judge Taylor\u2019s court, that he had few occasions to use his gavel, but he hammered fully five minutes. Atticus was on his feet at the bench saying something to him, Mr. Heck Tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom. Behind us, there was an angry muffled groan from the colored people.Reverend Sykes leaned across Dill and me, pulling at Jem\u2019s elbow. \u201cMr. Jem,\u201d he said, \u201cyou better take Miss Jean Louise home. Mr. Jem, you hear me?\u201dJem turned his head. \u201cScout, go home. Dill, you\u2019n\u2019Scout go home.\u201d\u201cYou gotta make me first,\u201d I said, remembering Atticus\u2019s blessed dictum.Jem scowled furiously at me, then said to Reverend Sykes, \u201cI think it\u2019s okay, Reverend, she doesn\u2019t understand it.\u201dI was mortally offended. \u201cI most certainly do, I c\u2019n understand anything you can.\u201d\u201cAw hush. She doesn\u2019t understand it, Reverend, she ain\u2019t nine yet.\u201dReverend Sykes\u2019s black eyes were anxious. \u201cMr. Finch know you all are here? This ain\u2019t fit for Miss Jean Louise or you boys either.\u201dJem shook his head. \u201cHe can\u2019t see us this far away. It\u2019s all right, Reverend.\u201dI knew Jem would win, because I knew nothing could make him leave now. Dill and I were safe, for a while: Atticus could see us from where he was, if he looked.As Judge Taylor banged his gavel, Mr. Ewell was sitting smugly in the witness chair, surveying his handiwork. With one phrase he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky, tense, murmuring crowd, being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-pink: the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil.In possession of his court once more, Judge Taylor leaned back in his chair. He looked suddenly weary; his age was showing, and I thought about what Atticus had said\u2014he and Mrs. Taylor didn\u2019t kiss much\u2014he must have been nearly seventy.\u201cThere has been a request,\u201d Judge Taylor said, \u201cthat this courtroom be cleared of spectators, or at least of women and children, a request that will be denied for the time being. People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for, and they have the right to subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one thing: you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom, but you won\u2019t leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charges. Mr. Ewell, you will keep your testimony within the confines of Christian English usage, if that is possible. Proceed, Mr. Gilmer.\u201dMr. Ewell reminded me of a deaf-mute. I was sure he had never heard the words Judge Taylor directed at him\u2014his mouth struggled silently with them\u2014but their import registered on his face. Smugness faded from it, replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled Judge Taylor not at all: as long as Mr. Ewell was on the stand, the judge kept his eyes on him, as if daring him to make a false move.Mr. Gilmer and Atticus exchanged glances. Atticus was sitting down again, his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face. Mr. Gilmer looked rather desperate. A question from Judge Taylor made him relax: \u201cMr. Ewell, did you see the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter?\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201dThe spectators were quiet, but the defendant said something. Atticus whispered to him, and Tom Robinson was silent.\u201cYou say you were at the window?\u201d asked Mr. Gilmer.\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cHow far is it from the ground?\u201d\u201c\u2019bout three foot.\u201d\u201cDid you have a clear view of the room?\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u201cHow did the room look?\u201d\u201cWell, it was all slung about, like there was a fight.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do when you saw the defendant?\u201d\u201cWell, I run around the house to get in, but he run out the front door just ahead of me. I sawed who he was, all right. I was too distracted about Mayella to run after\u2019im. I run in the house and she was lyin\u2019 on the floor squallin\u2019\u2014\u201d\u201cThen what did you do?\u201d\u201cWhy, I run for Tate quick as I could. I knowed who it was, all right, lived down yonder in that nigger-nest, passed the house every day. Jedge, I\u2019ve asked this county for fifteen years to clean out that nest down yonder, they\u2019re dangerous to live around \u2019sides devaluin\u2019 my property\u2014\u201d\u201cThank you, Mr. Ewell,\u201d said Mr. Gilmer hurriedly.The witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into Atticus, who had risen to question him. Judge Taylor permitted the court to laugh.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cJust a minute, sir,\u201d said Atticus genially. \u201cCould I ask you a question or two?\u201dMr. Ewell backed up into the witness chair, settled himself, and regarded Atticus with haughty suspicion, an expression common to Maycomb County witnesses when confronted by opposing counsel.\u201cMr. Ewell,\u201d Atticus began, \u201cfolks were doing a lot of running that night. Let\u2019s see, you say you ran into the house, you ran to the window, you ran inside, you ran to Mayella, you ran for Mr. Tate. Did you, during all this running, run for a doctor?\u201d\u201cWadn\u2019t no need to. I seen what happened.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cWeren\u2019t you concerned with Mayella\u2019s condition?\u201d\u201cI most positively was,\u201d said Mr. Ewell. \u201cI seen who done it.\u201d\u201cNo, I mean her physical condition. Did you not think the nature of her injuries warranted immediate medical attention?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you think she should have had a doctor, immediately?\u201dThe witness said he never thought of it, he had never called a doctor to any of his\u2019n in his life, and if he had it would have cost him five dollars. \u201cThat all?\u201d he asked.\u201cNot quite,\u201d said Atticus casually. \u201cMr. Ewell, you heard the sheriff\u2019s testimony, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cYou were in the courtroom when Mr. Heck Tate was on the stand, weren\u2019t you? You heard everything he said, didn\u2019t you?\u201dMr. Ewell considered the matter carefully, and seemed to decide that the question was safe.\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\u201cDo you agree with his description of Mayella\u2019s injuries?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201dAtticus looked around at Mr. Gilmer and smiled. Mr. Ewell seemed determined not to give the defense the time of day.\u201cMr. Tate testified that her right eye was blackened, that she was beaten around the\u2014\u201d\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said the witness. \u201cI hold with everything Tate said.\u201d\u201cYou do?\u201d asked Atticus mildly. \u201cI just want to make sure.\u201d He went to the court reporter, said something, and the reporter entertained us for some minutes by reading Mr. Tate\u2019s testimony as if it were stock-market quotations: \u201c. . . which eye her left oh yes that\u2019d make it her right it was her right eye Mr. Finch I remember now she was bunged.\u201d He flipped the page. \u201cUp on that side of the face Sheriff please repeat what you said it was her right eye I said\u2014\u201d\u201cThank you, Bert,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cYou heard it again, Mr. Ewell. Do you have anything to add to it? Do you agree with the sheriff?\u201d\u201cI holds with Tate. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up.\u201dThe little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench. It was becoming evident that he thought Atticus an easy match. He seemed to grow ruddy again; his chest swelled, and once more he was a red little rooster. I thought he\u2019d burst his shirt at Atticus\u2019s next question:\u201cMr. Ewell, can you read and write?\u201dMr. Gilmer interrupted. \u201cObjection,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t see what witness\u2019s literacy has to do with the case, irrelevant\u2019n\u2019immaterial.\u201dJudge Taylor was about to speak but Atticus said, \u201cJudge, if you\u2019ll allow the question plus another one you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d\u201cAll right, let\u2019s see,\u201d said Judge Taylor, \u201cbut make sure we see, Atticus. Overruled.\u201dMr. Gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the state of Mr. Ewell\u2019s education had on the case.\u201cI\u2019ll repeat the question,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cCan you read and write?\u201d\u201cI most positively can.\u201d\u201cWill you write your name and show us?\u201d\u201cI most positively will. How do you think I sign my relief checks?\u201dMr. Ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens. The whispers and chuckles below us probably had to do with what a card he was.I was becoming nervous. Atticus seemed to know what he was doing\u2014but it seemed to me that he\u2019d gone frog-sticking without a light. Never, never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you don\u2019t already know the answer to, was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food. Do it, and you\u2019ll often get an answer you don\u2019t want, an answer that might wreck your case.Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out an envelope, then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen. He moved leisurely, and had turned so that he was in full view of the jury. He unscrewed the fountain-pen cap and placed it gently on his table. He shook the pen a little, then handed it with the envelope to the witness. \u201cWould you write your name for us?\u201d he asked. \u201cClearly now, so the jury can see you do it.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Mr. Ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see Judge Taylor staring at him as if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witness stand, to see Mr. Gilmer half-sitting, half-standing at his table. The jury was watching him, one man was leaning forward with his hands over the railing.\u201cWhat\u2019s so interestin\u2019?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou\u2019re left-handed, Mr. Ewell,\u201d said Judge Taylor.Mr. Ewell turned angrily to the judge and said he didn\u2019t see what his being left-handed had to do with it, that he was a Christ-fearing man and Atticus Finch was taking advantage of him. Tricking lawyers like Atticus Finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways. He had told them what happened, he\u2019d say it again and again\u2014which he did. Nothing Atticus asked him after that shook his story, that he\u2019d looked through the window, then ran the nigger off, then ran for the sheriff. Atticus finally dismissed him.Mr. Gilmer asked him one more question. \u201cAbout your writing with your left hand, are you ambidextrous, Mr. Ewell?\u201d\u201cI most positively am not, I can use one hand good as the other. One hand good as the other,\u201d he added, glaring at the defense table.Jem seemed to be having a quiet fit. He was pounding the balcony rail softly, and once he whispered, \u201cWe\u2019ve got him.\u201dI didn\u2019t think so: Atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. That much I could follow. If her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. Sherlock Holmes and Jem Finch would agree. But Tom Robinson could easily be left-handed, too. Like Mr. Heck Tate, I imagined a person facing me, went through a swift mental pantomime, and concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left. I looked down at him. His back was to us, but I could see his broad shoulders and bull-thick neck. He could easily have done it. I thought Jem was counting his chickens.18But someone was booming again.\u201cMayella Violet Ewell\u2014!\u201dA young girl walked to the witness stand. As she raised her hand and swore that the evidence she gave would be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help her God, she seemed somehow fragile-looking, but when she sat facing us in the witness chair she became what she was, a thick-bodied girl accustomed to strenuous labor.In Maycomb County, it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly, as opposed to yearly lavations: Mr. Ewell had a scalded look; as if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layers of dirt, his skin appeared to be sensitive to the elements. Mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean, and I was reminded of the row of red geraniums in the Ewell yard.Mr. Gilmer asked Mayella to tell the jury in her own words what happened on the evening of November twenty-first of last year, just in her own words, please.Mayella sat silently.\u201cWhere were you at dusk on that evening?\u201d began Mr. Gilmer patiently.\u201cOn the porch.\u201d\u201cWhich porch?\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t but one, the front porch.\u201d\u201cWhat were you doing on the porch?\u201d\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201dJudge Taylor said, \u201cJust tell us what happened. You can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201dMayella stared at him and burst into tears. She covered her mouth with her hands and sobbed. Judge Taylor let her cry for a while, then he said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough now. Don\u2019t be \u2019fraid of anybody here, as long as you tell the truth. All this is strange to you, I know, but you\u2019ve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear. What are you scared of?\u201dMayella said something behind her hands. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked the judge.\u201cHim,\u201d she sobbed, pointing at Atticus.\u201cMr. Finch?\u201dShe nodded vigorously, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t want him doin\u2019 me like he done Papa, tryin\u2019 to make him out left-handed . . .\u201dJudge Taylor scratched his thick white hair. It was plain that he had never been confronted with a problem of this kind. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked.\u201cNineteen-and-a-half,\u201d Mayella said.Judge Taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing tones. \u201cMr. Finch has no idea of scaring you,\u201d he growled, \u201cand if he did, I\u2019m here to stop him. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sitting up here for. Now you\u2019re a big girl, so you just sit up straight and tell the\u2014tell us what happened to you. You can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201dI whispered to Jem, \u201cHas she got good sense?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem was squinting down at the witness stand. \u201cCan\u2019t tell yet,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got enough sense to get the judge sorry for her, but she might be just\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know.\u201dMollified, Mayella gave Atticus a final terrified glance and said to Mr. Gilmer, \u201cWell sir, I was on the porch and\u2014and he came along and, you see, there was this old chiffarobe in the yard Papa\u2019d brought in to chop up for kindlin\u2019\u2014Papa told me to do it while he was off in the woods but I wadn\u2019t feelin\u2019 strong enough then, so he came by\u2014\u201d\u201cWho is \u2018he\u2019?\u201dMayella pointed to Tom Robinson. \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask you to be more specific, please,\u201d said Mr. Gilmer. \u201cThe reporter can\u2019t put down gestures very well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019n yonder,\u201d she said. \u201cRobinson.\u201d\u201cThen what happened?\u201d\u201cI said come here, nigger, and bust up this chiffarobe for me, I gotta nickel for you. He coulda done it easy enough, he could. So he come in the yard an\u2019 I went in the house to get him the nickel and I turned around an \u2019fore I knew it he was on me. Just run up behind me, he did. He got me round the neck, cussin\u2019 me an\u2019 sayin\u2019 dirt\u2014I fought\u2019n\u2019hollered, but he had me round the neck. He hit me agin an\u2019 agin\u2014\u201dMr. Gilmer waited for Mayella to collect herself: she had twisted her handkerchief into a sweaty rope; when she opened it to wipe her face it was a mass of creases from her hot hands. She waited for Mr. Gilmer to ask another question, but when he didn\u2019t she said, \u201c\u2014he chunked me on the floor an\u2019 choked me\u2019n took advantage of me.\u201d\u201cDid you scream?\u201d asked Mr. Gilmer. \u201cDid you scream and fight back?\u201d\u201cReckon I did, hollered for all I was worth, kicked and hollered loud as I could.\u201d\u201cThen what happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember too good, but next thing I knew Papa was in the room a\u2019standin\u2019 over me hollerin\u2019 who done it, who done it? Then I sorta fainted an\u2019 the next thing I knew Mr. Tate was pullin\u2019 me up offa the floor and leadin\u2019 me to the water bucket.\u201dApparently Mayella\u2019s recital had given her confidence, but it was not her father\u2019s brash kind: there was something stealthy about hers, like a steady-eyed cat with a twitchy tail.\u201cYou say you fought him off as hard as you could? Fought him tooth and nail?\u201d asked Mr. Gilmer.\u201cI positively did,\u201d Mayella echoed her father.\u201cYou are positive that he took full advantage of you?\u201dMayella\u2019s face contorted, and I was afraid that she would cry again. Instead, she said, \u201cHe done what he was after.\u201dMr. Gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s all for the time being,\u201d he said pleasantly, \u201cbut you stay there. I expect big bad Mr. Finch has some questions to ask you.\u201d\u201cState will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense,\u201d murmured Judge Taylor primly, \u201cat least not at this time.\u201dAtticus got up grinning, but instead of walking to the witness stand, he opened his coat and hooked his thumbs in his vest, then he walked slowly across the room to the windows. He looked out, but didn\u2019t seem especially interested in what he saw, then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand. From long years of experience, I could tell he was trying to come to a decision about something.\u201cMiss Mayella,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cI won\u2019t try to scare you for a while, not yet. Let\u2019s just get acquainted. How old are you?\u201d\u201cSaid I was nineteen, said it to the judge yonder.\u201d Mayella jerked her head resentfully at the bench.\u201cSo you did, so you did, ma\u2019am. You\u2019ll have to bear with me, Miss Mayella, I\u2019m getting along and can\u2019t remember as well as I used to. I might ask you things you\u2019ve already said before, but you\u2019ll give me an answer, won\u2019t you? Good.\u201dI could see nothing in Mayella\u2019s expression to justify Atticus\u2019s assumption that he had secured her wholehearted cooperation. She was looking at him furiously.\u201cWon\u2019t answer a word you say long as you keep on mockin\u2019 me,\u201d she said.\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d asked Atticus, startled.\u201cLong\u2019s you keep on makin\u2019 fun o\u2019me.\u201dJudge Taylor said, \u201cMr. Finch is not making fun of you. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dMayella looked from under lowered eyelids at Atticus, but she said to the judge: \u201cLong\u2019s he keeps on callin\u2019 me ma\u2019am and sayin\u2019 Miss Mayella. I don\u2019t hafta take his sass, I ain\u2019t called upon to take it.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Atticus resumed his stroll to the windows and let Judge Taylor handle this one. Judge Taylor was not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity, but I did feel a pang for him as he tried to explain. \u201cThat\u2019s just Mr. Finch\u2019s way,\u201d he told Mayella. \u201cWe\u2019ve done business in this court for years and years, and Mr. Finch is always courteous to everybody. He\u2019s not trying to mock you, he\u2019s trying to be polite. That\u2019s just his way.\u201dThe judge leaned back. \u201cAtticus, let\u2019s get on with these proceedings, and let the record show that the witness has not been sassed, her views to the contrary.\u201dI wondered if anybody had ever called her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d or \u201cMiss Mayella\u201d in her life; probably not, as she took offense to routine courtesy. What on earth was her life like? I soon found out.\u201cYou say you\u2019re nineteen,\u201d Atticus resumed. \u201cHow many sisters and brothers have you?\u201d He walked from the windows back to the stand.\u201cSeb\u2019m,\u201d she said, and I wondered if they were all like the specimen I had seen the first day I started to school.\u201cYou the eldest? The oldest?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow long has your mother been dead?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know\u2014long time.\u201d\u201cDid you ever go to school?\u201d\u201cRead\u2019n\u2019write good as Papa yonder.\u201dMayella sounded like a Mr. Jingle in a book I had been reading.\u201cHow long did you go to school?\u201d\u201cTwo year\u2014three year\u2014dunno.\u201dSlowly but surely I began to see the pattern of Atticus\u2019s questions: from questions that Mr. Gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to, Atticus was quietly building up before the jury a picture of the Ewells\u2019 home life. The jury learned the following things: their relief check was far from enough to feed the family, and there was strong suspicion that Papa drank it up anyway\u2014he sometimes went off in the swamp for days and came home sick; the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes, but when it was, you could make dandy ones from strips of old tires; the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of the dump\u2014they kept the surrounding area clear of trash\u2014and it was everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went: if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water; the younger children had perpetual colds and suffered from chronic ground-itch; there was a lady who came around sometimes and asked Mayella why she didn\u2019t stay in school\u2014she wrote down the answer; with two members of the family reading and writing, there was no need for the rest of them to learn\u2014Papa needed them at home.\u201cMiss Mayella,\u201d said Atticus, in spite of himself, \u201ca nineteen-year-old girl like you must have friends. Who are your friends?\u201dThe witness frowned as if puzzled. \u201cFriends?\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t you know anyone near your age, or older, or younger? Boys and girls? Just ordinary friends?\u201dMayella\u2019s hostility, which had subsided to grudging neutrality, flared again. \u201cYou makin\u2019 fun o\u2019me again, Mr. Finch?\u201dAtticus let her question answer his.\u201cDo you love your father, Miss Mayella?\u201d was his next.\u201cLove him, whatcha mean?\u201d\u201cI mean, is he good to you, is he easy to get along with?\u201d\u201cHe does tollable, \u2019cept when\u2014\u201d\u201cExcept when?\u201dMayella looked at her father, who was sitting with his chair tipped against the railing. He sat up straight and waited for her to answer.\u201cExcept when nothin\u2019,\u201d said Mayella. \u201cI said he does tollable.\u201dMr. Ewell leaned back again.\u201cExcept when he\u2019s drinking?\u201d asked Atticus so gently that Mayella nodded.\u201cDoes he ever go after you?\u201d\u201cHow you mean?\u201d\u201cWhen he\u2019s\u2014riled, has he ever beaten you?\u201dMayella looked around, down at the court reporter, up at the judge. \u201cAnswer the question, Miss Mayella,\u201d said Judge Taylor.\u201cMy paw\u2019s never touched a hair o\u2019 my head in my life,\u201d she declared firmly. \u201cHe never touched me.\u201dAtticus\u2019s glasses had slipped a little, and he pushed them up on his nose. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good visit, Miss Mayella, and now I guess we\u2019d better get to the case. You say you asked Tom Robinson to come chop up a\u2014what was it?\u201d\u201cA chiffarobe, a old dresser full of drawers on one side.\u201d\u201cWas Tom Robinson well known to you?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWhaddya mean?\u201d\u201cI mean did you know who he was, where he lived?\u201dMayella nodded. \u201cI knowed who he was, he passed the house every day.\u201d\u201cWas this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence?\u201dMayella jumped slightly at the question. Atticus was making his slow pilgrimage to the windows, as he had been doing: he would ask a question, then look out, waiting for an answer. He did not see her involuntary jump, but it seemed to me that he knew she had moved. He turned around and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWas\u2014\u201d he began again.\u201cYes it was.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever ask him to come inside the fence before?\u201dShe was prepared now. \u201cI did not, I certainly did not.\u201d\u201cOne did not\u2019s enough,\u201d said Atticus serenely. \u201cYou never asked him to do odd jobs for you before?\u201d\u201cI mighta,\u201d conceded Mayella. \u201cThere was several niggers around.\u201d\u201cCan you remember any other occasions?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAll right, now to what happened. You said Tom Robinson was behind you in the room when you turned around, that right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou said he \u2018got you around the neck cussing and saying dirt\u2019\u2014is that right?\u201d\u201c\u2019t\u2019s right.\u201dAtticus\u2019s memory had suddenly become accurate. \u201cYou say \u2018he caught me and choked me and took advantage of me\u2019\u2014is that right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d\u201cDo you remember him beating you about the face?\u201dThe witness hesitated.\u201cYou seem sure enough that he choked you. All this time you were fighting back, remember? You \u2018kicked and hollered as loud as you could.\u2019 Do you remember him beating you about the face?\u201dMayella was silent. She seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself. I thought for a moment she was doing Mr. Heck Tate\u2019s and my trick of pretending there was a person in front of us. She glanced at Mr. Gilmer.\u201cIt\u2019s an easy question, Miss Mayella, so I\u2019ll try again. Do you remember him beating you about the face?\u201d Atticus\u2019s voice had lost its comfortableness; he was speaking in his arid, detached professional voice. \u201cDo you remember him beating you about the face?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t recollect if he hit me. I mean yes I do, he hit me.\u201d\u201cWas your last sentence your answer?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yes, he hit\u2014I just don\u2019t remember, I just don\u2019t remember . . . it all happened so quick.\u201dJudge Taylor looked sternly at Mayella. \u201cDon\u2019t you cry, young woman\u2014\u201d he began, but Atticus said, \u201cLet her cry if she wants to, Judge. We\u2019ve got all the time in the world.\u201dMayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at Atticus. \u201cI\u2019ll answer any question you got\u2014get me up here an\u2019 mock me, will you? I\u2019ll answer any question you got\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cThere\u2019re only a few more. Miss Mayella, not to be tedious, you\u2019ve testified that the defendant hit you, grabbed you around the neck, choked you, and took advantage of you. I want you to be sure you have the right man. Will you identify the man who raped you?\u201d\u201cI will, that\u2019s him right yonder.\u201dAtticus turned to the defendant. \u201cTom, stand up. Let Miss Mayella have a good long look at you. Is this the man, Miss Mayella?\u201dTom Robinson\u2019s powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt. He rose to his feet and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair. He looked oddly off balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony I could see that it was no use to him.\u201cScout,\u201d breathed Jem. \u201cScout, look! Reverend, he\u2019s crippled!\u201dReverend Sykes leaned across me and whispered to Jem. \u201cHe got it caught in a cotton gin, caught it in Mr. Dolphus Raymond\u2019s cotton gin when he was a boy . . . like to bled to death . . . tore all the muscles loose from his bones\u2014\u201dAtticus said, \u201cIs this the man who raped you?\u201d\u201cIt most certainly is.\u201dAtticus\u2019s next question was one word long. \u201cHow?\u201dMayella was raging. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he done it, but he done it\u2014I said it all happened so fast I\u2014\u201d\u201cNow let\u2019s consider this calmly\u2014\u201d began Atticus, but Mr. Gilmer interrupted with an objection: he was not irrelevant or immaterial, but Atticus was browbeating the witness.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Judge Taylor laughed outright. \u201cOh sit down, Horace, he\u2019s doing nothing of the sort. If anything, the witness\u2019s browbeating Atticus.\u201dJudge Taylor was the only person in the courtroom who laughed. Even the babies were still, and I suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mothers\u2019 breasts.\u201cNow,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cMiss Mayella, you\u2019ve testified that the defendant choked and beat you\u2014you didn\u2019t say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you cold, but you turned around and there he was\u2014\u201d Atticus was back behind his table, and he emphasized his words by tapping his knuckles on it. \u201c\u2014do you wish to reconsider any of your testimony?\u201d\u201cYou want me to say something that didn\u2019t happen?\u201d\u201cNo ma\u2019am, I want you to say something that did happen.

I ducked and it glanced off.\u201d Mayella had finally seen the light.\u201cYou\u2019re becoming suddenly clear on this point. A while ago you couldn\u2019t remember too well, could you?\u201d\u201cI said he hit me.\u201d\u201cAll right. He choked you, he hit you, then he raped you, that right?\u201d\u201cIt most certainly is.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a strong girl, what were you doing all the time, just standing there?\u201d\u201cI told\u2019ja I hollered\u2019n\u2019kicked\u2019n\u2019fought\u2014\u201dAtticus reached up and took off his glasses, turned his good right eye to the witness, and rained questions on her. Judge Taylor said, \u201cOne question at a time, Atticus. Give the witness a chance to answer.\u201d\u201cAll right, why didn\u2019t you run?\u201d\u201cI tried to . . .\u201d\u201cTried to? What kept you from it?\u201d\u201cI\u2014he slung me down. That\u2019s what he did, he slung me down\u2019n got on top of me.\u201d\u201cYou were screaming all this time?\u201d\u201cI certainly was.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t the other children hear you? Where were they? At the dump?\u201dNo answer.\u201cWhere were they?\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your screams make them come running? The dump\u2019s closer than the woods, isn\u2019t it?\u201dNo answer.\u201cOr didn\u2019t you scream until you saw your father in the window? You didn\u2019t think to scream until then, did you?\u201dNo answer.\u201cDid you scream first at your father instead of at Tom Robinson? Was that it?\u201dNo answer.\u201cWho beat you up? Tom Robinson or your father?\u201dNo answer.\u201cWhat did your father see in the window, the crime of rape or the best defense to it? Why don\u2019t you tell the truth, child, didn\u2019t Bob Ewell beat you up?\u201dWhen Atticus turned away from Mayella he looked like his stomach hurt, but Mayella\u2019s face was a mixture of terror and fury. Atticus sat down wearily and polished his glasses with his handkerchief.Suddenly Mayella became articulate. \u201cI got somethin\u2019 to say,\u201d she said.Atticus raised his head. \u201cDo you want to tell us what happened?\u201dBut she did not hear the compassion in his invitation. \u201cI got somethin\u2019 to say an\u2019 then I ain\u2019t gonna say no more. That nigger yonder took advantage of me an\u2019 if you fine fancy gentlemen don\u2019t wanta do nothin\u2019 about it then you\u2019re all yellow stinkin\u2019 cowards, stinkin\u2019 cowards, the lot of you. Your fancy airs don\u2019t come to nothin\u2019\u2014 your ma\u2019amin\u2019 and Miss Mayellerin\u2019 don\u2019t come to nothin\u2019, Mr. Finch\u2014\u201dThen she burst into real tears. Her shoulders shook with angry sobs. She was as good as her word. She answered no more questions, even when Mr. Gilmer tried to get her back on the track. I guess if she hadn\u2019t been so poor and ignorant, Judge Taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom. Somehow, Atticus had hit her hard in a way that was not clear to me, but it gave him no pleasure to do so. He sat with his head down, and I never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred Mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by Atticus\u2019s table.When Mr. Gilmer told Judge Taylor that the state rested, Judge Taylor said, \u201cIt\u2019s time we all did. We\u2019ll take ten minutes.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Atticus and Mr. Gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered, then they left the courtroom by a door behind the witness stand, which was a signal for us all to stretch. I discovered that I had been sitting on the edge of the long bench, and I was somewhat numb. Jem got up and yawned, Dill did likewise, and Reverend Sykes wiped his face on his hat. The temperature was an easy ninety, he said.Mr. Braxton Underwood, who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the Press, soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain, allowed his bitter eyes to rove over the Colored balcony, and they met mine. He gave a snort and looked away.\u201cJem,\u201d I said, \u201cMr. Underwood\u2019s seen us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay. He won\u2019t tell Atticus, he\u2019ll just put it on the social side of the Tribune.\u201d Jem turned back to Dill, explaining, I suppose, the finer points of the trial to him, but I wondered what they were. There had been no lengthy debates between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer on any points; Mr. Gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly; witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are, with few objections. But Atticus had once told us that in Judge Taylor\u2019s court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench. He distilled this for me to mean that Judge Taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep, but he was seldom reversed, and that was the proof of the pudding. Atticus said he was a good judge.Presently Judge Taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair. He took a cigar from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully. I punched Dill. Having passed the judge\u2019s inspection, the cigar suffered a vicious bite. \u201cWe come down sometimes to watch him,\u201d I explained. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take him the rest of the afternoon, now. You watch.\u201d Unaware of public scrutiny from above, Judge Taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying, \u201cFhluck!\u201d He hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh. \u201cBet he was hell with a spitball,\u201d murmured Dill.As a rule, a recess meant a general exodus, but today people weren\u2019t moving. Even the Idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had remained standing along the walls. I guess Mr. Heck Tate had reserved the county toilet for court officials.Atticus and Mr. Gilmer returned, and Judge Taylor looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 on to four,\u201d he said, which was intriguing, as the courthouse clock must have struck the hour at least twice. I had not heard it or felt its vibrations.\u201cShall we try to wind up this afternoon?\u201d asked Judge Taylor. \u201cHow \u2019bout it, Atticus?\u201d\u201cI think we can,\u201d said Atticus.\u201cHow many witnesses you got?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cWell, call him.\u201d19Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit the clerk\u2019s table. He was trying again when Judge Taylor growled, \u201cThat\u2019ll do, Tom.\u201d Tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair. Atticus very quickly induced him to tell us:Tom was twenty-five years of age; he was married with three children; he had been in trouble with the law before: he once received thirty days for disorderly conduct.\u201cIt must have been disorderly,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cWhat did it consist of?\u201d\u201cGot in a fight with another man, he tried to cut me.\u201d\u201cDid he succeed?\u201d\u201cYes suh, a little, not enough to hurt. You see, I\u2014\u201d Tom moved his left shoulder.\u201cYes,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cYou were both convicted?\u201d\u201cYes suh, I had to serve \u2019cause I couldn\u2019t pay the fine. Other fellow paid his\u2019n.\u201dDill learned across me and asked Jem what Atticus was doing. Jem said Atticus was showing the jury that Tom had nothing to hide.\u201cWere you acquainted with Mayella Violet Ewell?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cYes suh, I had to pass her place goin\u2019 to and from the field every day.\u201d\u201cWhose field?\u201d\u201cI picks for Mr. Link Deas.\u201d\u201cWere you picking cotton in November?\u201d\u201cNo suh, I works in his yard fall an\u2019 wintertime. I works pretty steady for him all year round, he\u2019s got a lot of pecan trees\u2019n things.\u201d\u201cYou say you had to pass the Ewell place to get to and from work. Is there any other way to go?\u201d\u201cNo suh, none\u2019s I know of.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cTom, did she ever speak to you?\u201d\u201cWhy, yes suh, I\u2019d tip m\u2019hat when I\u2019d go by, and one day she asked me to come inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her.\u201d\u201cWhen did she ask you to chop up the\u2014the chiffarobe?\u201d\u201cMr. Finch, it was way last spring. I remember it because it was choppin\u2019 time and I had my hoe with me. I said I didn\u2019t have nothin\u2019 but this hoe, but she said she had a hatchet. She give me the hatchet and I broke up the chiffarobe. She said, \u2018I reckon I\u2019ll hafta give you a nickel, won\u2019t I?\u2019 I said, \u2018No ma\u2019am, there ain\u2019t no charge.\u2019 Then I went home. Mr. Finch, that was way last spring, way over a year ago.\u201d\u201cDid you ever go on the place again?\u201d\u201cYes suh.\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cWell, I went lots of times.\u201dJudge Taylor instinctively reached for his gavel, but let his hand fall. The murmur below us died without his help.\u201cUnder what circumstances?\u201d\u201cPlease, suh?\u201d\u201cWhy did you go inside the fence lots of times?\u201dTom Robinson\u2019s forehead relaxed. \u201cShe\u2019d call me in, suh. Seemed like every time I passed by yonder she\u2019d have some little somethin\u2019 for me to do\u2014choppin\u2019 kindlin\u2019, totin\u2019 water for her. She watered them red flowers every day\u2014\u201d\u201cWere you paid for your services?\u201d\u201cNo suh, not after she offered me a nickel the first time. I was glad to do it, Mr. Ewell didn\u2019t seem to help her none, and neither did the chillun, and I knowed she didn\u2019t have no nickels to spare.\u201d\u201cWhere were the other children?\u201d\u201cThey was always around, all over the place. They\u2019d watch me work, some of \u2019em, some of \u2019em\u2019d set in the window.\u201d\u201cWould Miss Mayella talk to you?\u201d\u201cYes suh, she talked to me.\u201dAs Tom Robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that Mayella Ewell must have been the loneliest person in the world. She was even lonelier than Boo Radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. When Atticus asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she thought he was making fun of her. She was as sad, I thought, as what Jem called a mixed child: white people wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her because she lived among pigs; Negroes wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her because she was white. She couldn\u2019t live like Mr. Dolphus Raymond, who preferred the company of Negroes, because she didn\u2019t own a riverbank and she wasn\u2019t from a fine old family. Nobody said, \u201cThat\u2019s just their way,\u201d about the Ewells. Maycomb gave them Christmas baskets, welfare money, and the back of its hand. Tom Robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her. But she said he took advantage of her, and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were dirt beneath her feet.\u201cDid you ever,\u201d Atticus interrupted my meditations, \u201cat any time, go on the Ewell property\u2014did you ever set foot on the Ewell property without an express invitation from one of them?\u201d\u201cNo suh, Mr. Finch, I never did. I wouldn\u2019t do that, suh.\u201dAtticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness was lying or telling the truth was to listen rather than watch: I applied his test\u2014Tom denied it three times in one breath, but quietly, with no hint of whining in his voice, and I found myself believing him in spite of his protesting too much. He seemed to be a respectable Negro, and a respectable Negro would never go up into somebody\u2019s yard of his own volition.\u201cTom, what happened to you on the evening of November twenty-first of last year?\u201dBelow us, the spectators drew a collective breath and leaned forward. Behind us, the Negroes did the same.Tom was a black-velvet Negro, not shiny, but soft black velvet. The whites of his eyes shone in his face, and when he spoke we saw flashes of his teeth. If he had been whole, he would have been a fine specimen of a man.\u201cMr. Finch,\u201d he said, \u201cI was goin\u2019 home as usual that evenin\u2019, an\u2019 when I passed the Ewell place Miss Mayella were on the porch, like she said she were. It seemed real quiet like, an\u2019 I didn\u2019t quite know why. I was studyin\u2019 why, just passin\u2019 by, when she says for me to come there and help her a minute. Well, I went inside the fence an\u2019 looked around for some kindlin\u2019 to work on, but I didn\u2019t see none, and she says, \u2018Naw, I got somethin\u2019 for you to do in the house. Th\u2019 old door\u2019s off its hinges an\u2019 fall\u2019s comin\u2019 on pretty fast.\u2019 I said you got a screwdriver, Miss Mayella? She said she sho\u2019 had. Well, I went up the steps an\u2019 she motioned me to come inside, and I went in the front room an\u2019 looked at the door. I said Miss Mayella, this door look all right. I pulled it back\u2019n forth and those hinges was all right. Then she shet the door in my face. Mr. Finch, I was wonderin\u2019 why it was so quiet like, an\u2019 it come to me that there weren\u2019t a chile on the place, not a one of \u2019em, and I said Miss Mayella, where the chillun?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},

She says, \u2018Took me a slap year to save seb\u2019m nickels, but I done it. They all gone to town.\u2019 \u201dTom\u2019s discomfort was not from the humidity. \u201cWhat did you say then, Tom?\u201d asked Atticus.\u201cI said somethin\u2019 like, why Miss Mayella, that\u2019s right smart o\u2019you to treat \u2019em. An\u2019 she said, \u2018You think so?\u2019 I don\u2019t think she understood what I was thinkin\u2019\u2014I meant it was smart of her to save like that, an\u2019 nice of her to treat \u2019em.\u201d\u201cI understand you, Tom.

Most as tall as the room. So I done what she told me, an\u2019 I was just reachin\u2019 when the next thing I knows she\u2014she\u2019d grabbed me round the legs, grabbed me round th\u2019 legs, Mr. Finch. She scared me so bad I hopped down an\u2019 turned the chair over\u2014that was the only thing, only furniture, \u2019sturbed in that room, Mr. Finch, when I left it. I swear \u2019fore God.\u201d\u201cWhat happened after you turned the chair over?\u201dTom Robinson had come to a dead stop. He glanced at Atticus, then at the jury, then at Mr. Underwood sitting across the room.\u201cTom, you\u2019re sworn to tell the whole truth. Will you tell it?\u201dTom ran his hand nervously over his mouth.\u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d said Judge Taylor. One-third of his cigar had vanished.\u201cMr. Finch, I got down offa that chair an\u2019 turned around an\u2019 she sorta jumped on me.\u201d\u201cJumped on you? Violently?\u201d\u201cNo suh, she\u2014she hugged me. She hugged me round the waist.\u201dThis time Judge Taylor\u2019s gavel came down with a bang, and as it did the overhead lights went on in the courtroom. Darkness had not come, but the afternoon sun had left the windows. Judge Taylor quickly restored order.\u201cThen what did she do?\u201dThe witness swallowed hard. \u201cShe reached up an\u2019 kissed me \u2019side of th\u2019 face. She says she never kissed a grown man before an\u2019 she might as well kiss a nigger. She says what her papa do to her don\u2019t count. She says, \u2018Kiss me back, nigger.\u2019 I say Miss Mayella lemme outa here an\u2019 tried to run but she got her back to the door an\u2019 I\u2019da had to push her. I didn\u2019t wanta harm her, Mr. Finch, an\u2019 I say lemme pass, but just when I say it Mr. Ewell yonder hollered through th\u2019 window.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201dTom Robinson swallowed again, and his eyes widened. \u201cSomethin\u2019 not fittin\u2019 to say\u2014not fittin\u2019 for these folks\u2019n chillun to hear\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat did he say, Tom?

Until my father explained it to me later, I did not understand the subtlety of Tom\u2019s predicament: he would not have dared strike a white woman under any circumstances and expect to live long, so he took the first opportunity to run\u2014a sure sign of guilt.\u201cTom, go back once more to Mr. Ewell,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cDid he say anything to you?\u201d\u201cNot anything, suh.

His speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar. \u201cLink Deas,\u201d he yelled, \u201cif you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath and at the proper time, but until then you get out of this room, you hear me? Get out of this room, sir, you hear me? I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll listen to this case again!\u201dJudge Taylor looked daggers at Atticus, as if daring him to speak, but Atticus had ducked his head and was laughing into his lap. I remembered something he had said about Judge Taylor\u2019s ex cathedra remarks sometimes exceeding his duty, but that few lawyers ever did anything about them. I looked at Jem, but Jem shook his head. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like one of the jurymen got up and started talking,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be different then. Mr. Link was just disturbin\u2019 the peace or something.\u201dJudge Taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written down after Mr. Finch if you were a nigger like me you\u2019d be scared too, and told the jury to disregard the interruption. He looked suspiciously down the middle aisle and waited, I suppose, for Mr. Link Deas to effect total departure. Then he said, \u201cGo ahead, Mr. Gilmer.\u201d\u201cYou were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct, Robinson?\u201d asked Mr. Gilmer.\u201cYes suh.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019d the nigger look like when you got through with him?\u201d\u201cHe beat me, Mr. Gilmer.\u201d\u201cYes, but you were convicted, weren\u2019t you?\u201dAtticus raised his head. \u201cIt was a misdemeanor and it\u2019s in the record, Judge.\u201d I thought he sounded tired.\u201cWitness\u2019ll answer, though,\u201d said Judge Taylor, just as wearily.\u201cYes suh, I got thirty days.\u201dI knew that Mr. Gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take advantage of Mayella Ewell, that was the only reason he cared. Reasons like that helped.\u201cRobinson, you\u2019re pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one hand, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes suh, I reckon so.\u201d\u201cStrong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor?\u201d\u201cI never done that, suh.\u201d\u201cBut you are strong enough to?\u201d\u201cI reckon so, suh.\u201d\u201cHad your eye on her a long time, hadn\u2019t you, boy?\u201d\u201cNo suh, I never looked at her.\u201d\u201cThen you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her, weren\u2019t you, boy?\u201d\u201cI was just tryin\u2019 to help her out, suh.\u201d\u201cThat was mighty generous of you, you had chores at home after your regular work, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes suh.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do them instead of Miss Ewell\u2019s?\u201d\u201cI done \u2019em both, suh.\u201d\u201cYou must have been pretty busy. Why?\u201d\u201cWhy what, suh?\u201d\u201cWhy were you so anxious to do that woman\u2019s chores?\u201dTom Robinson hesitated, searching for an answer. \u201cLooked like she didn\u2019t have anybody to help her, like I says\u2014\u201d\u201cWith Mr. Ewell and seven children on the place, boy?\u201d\u201cWell, I says it looked like they never help her none\u2014\u201d\u201cYou did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness, boy?\u201d\u201cTried to help her, I says.\u201dMr. Gilmer smiled grimly at the jury. \u201cYou\u2019re a mighty good fellow, it seems\u2014did all this for not one penny?\u201d\u201cYes, suh. I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try more\u2019n the rest of \u2019em\u2014\u201d\u201cYou felt sorry for her, you felt sorry for her?\u201d Mr. Gilmer seemed ready to rise to the ceiling.The witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair. But the damage was done. Below us, nobody liked Tom Robinson\u2019s answer. Mr. Gilmer paused a long time to let it sink in.\n</p>\n</div>"},

For some reason Dill had started crying and couldn\u2019t stop; quietly at first, then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony. Jem said if I didn\u2019t go with him he\u2019d make me, and Reverend Sykes said I\u2019d better go, so I went. Dill had seemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but I guessed he hadn\u2019t fully recovered from running away.\u201cAin\u2019t you feeling good?\u201d I asked, when we reached the bottom of the stairs.Dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps. Mr. Link Deas was a lonely figure on the top step. \u201cAnything happenin\u2019, Scout?\u201d he asked as we went by. \u201cNo sir,\u201d I answered over my shoulder. \u201cDill here, he\u2019s sick.\u201d\u201cCome on out under the trees,\u201d I said. \u201cHeat got you, I expect.\u201d We chose the fattest live oak and we sat under it.\u201cIt was just him I couldn\u2019t stand,\u201d Dill said.\u201cWho, Tom?\u201d\u201cThat old Mr. Gilmer doin\u2019 him thataway, talking so hateful to him\u2014\u201d\u201cDill, that\u2019s his job. Why, if we didn\u2019t have prosecutors\u2014well, we couldn\u2019t have defense attorneys, I reckon.\u201dDill exhaled patiently. \u201cI know all that, Scout. It was the way he said it made me sick, plain sick.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to act that way, Dill, he was cross\u2014\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t act that way when\u2014\u201d\u201cDill, those were his own witnesses.\u201d\u201cWell, Mr. Finch didn\u2019t act that way to Mayella and old man Ewell when he cross-examined them.

You\u2019ve never seen him get good\u2019n down on one yet. Why, when\u2014well, today Mr. Gilmer seemed to me like he wasn\u2019t half trying.

I had it: \u201cHe\u2019s the same in the courtroom as he is on the public streets.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d said Dill.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cI know what you mean, boy,\u201d said a voice behind us. We thought it came from the tree-trunk, but it belonged to Mr. Dolphus Raymond. He peered around the trunk at us. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thin-hided, it just makes you sick, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d20\u201cCome on round here, son, I got something that\u2019ll settle your stomach.\u201dAs Mr. Dolphus Raymond was an evil man I accepted his invitation reluctantly, but I followed Dill. Somehow, I didn\u2019t think Atticus would like it if we became friendly with Mr. Raymond, and I knew Aunt Alexandra wouldn\u2019t.\u201cHere,\u201d he said, offering Dill his paper sack with straws in it. \u201cTake a good sip, it\u2019ll quieten you.\u201dDill sucked on the straws, smiled, and pulled at length.\u201cHee hee,\u201d said Mr. Raymond, evidently taking delight in corrupting a child.\u201cDill, you watch out, now,\u201d I warned.Dill released the straws and grinned. \u201cScout, it\u2019s nothing but Coca-Cola.\u201dMr. Raymond sat up against the tree-trunk. He had been lying on the grass. \u201cYou little folks won\u2019t tell on me now, will you? It\u2019d ruin my reputation if you did.\u201d\u201cYou mean all you drink in that sack\u2019s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses, cottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. \u201cThat\u2019s all I drink, most of the time.\u201d\u201cThen you just pretend you\u2019re half\u2014? I beg your pardon, sir,\u201d I caught myself. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be\u2014\u201dMr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet question: \u201cWhy do you do like you do?\u201d\u201cWh\u2014oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cSome folks don\u2019t\u2014like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with \u2019em, I don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t like it. I do say I don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t like it, right enough\u2014but I don\u2019t say the hell with \u2019em, see?\u201dDill and I said, \u201cNo sir.\u201d\u201cI try to give \u2019em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. When I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this sack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond\u2019s in the clutches of whiskey\u2014that\u2019s why he won\u2019t change his ways. He can\u2019t help himself, that\u2019s why he lives the way he does.\u201d\u201cThat ain\u2019t honest, Mr. Raymond, making yourself out badder\u2019n you are already\u2014\u201d\u201cIt ain\u2019t honest but it\u2019s mighty helpful to folks. Secretly, Miss Finch, I\u2019m not much of a drinker, but you see they could never, never understand that I live like I do because that\u2019s the way I want to live.\u201dI had a feeling that I shouldn\u2019t be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed children and didn\u2019t care who knew it, but he was fascinating. I had never encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself. But why had he entrusted us with his deepest secret? I asked him why.\u201cBecause you\u2019re children and you can understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cand because I heard that one\u2014\u201dHe jerked his head at Dill: \u201cThings haven\u2019t caught up with that one\u2019s instinct yet. Let him get a little older and he won\u2019t get sick and cry. Maybe things\u2019ll strike him as being\u2014not quite right, say, but he won\u2019t cry, not when he gets a few years on him.\u201d\u201cCry about what, Mr. Raymond?\u201d Dill\u2019s maleness was beginning to assert itself.\u201cCry about the simple hell people give other people\u2014without even thinking. Cry about the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that they\u2019re people, too.\u201d\u201cAtticus says cheatin\u2019 a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin\u2019 a white man,\u201d I muttered. \u201cSays it\u2019s the worst thing you can do.\u201dMr. Raymond said, \u201cI don\u2019t reckon it\u2019s\u2014Miss Jean Louise, you don\u2019t know your pa\u2019s not a run-of-the-mill man, it\u2019ll take a few years for that to sink in\u2014you haven\u2019t seen enough of the world yet. You haven\u2019t even seen this town, but all you gotta do is step back inside the courthouse.\u201dWhich reminded me that we were missing nearly all of Mr. Gilmer\u2019s cross-examination. I looked at the sun, and it was dropping fast behind the store-tops on the west side of the square. Between two fires, I could not decide which I wanted to jump into: Mr. Raymond or the 5th Judicial Circuit Court. \u201cC\u2019mon, Dill,\u201d I said. \u201cYou all right, now?\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cYeah. Glad to\u2019ve metcha, Mr. Raymond, and thanks for the drink, it was mighty settlin\u2019.\u201dWe raced back to the courthouse, up the steps, up two flights of stairs, and edged our way along the balcony rail. Reverend Sykes had saved our seats.The courtroom was still, and again I wondered where the babies were. Judge Taylor\u2019s cigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth; Mr. Gilmer was writing on one of the yellow pads on his table, trying to outdo the court reporter, whose hand was jerking rapidly. \u201cShoot,\u201d I muttered, \u201cwe missed it.\u201dAtticus was halfway through his speech to the jury. He had evidently pulled some papers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair, because they were on his table. Tom Robinson was toying with them.\u201c. . . absence of any corroborative evidence, this man was indicted on a capital charge and is now on trial for his life. . . .\u201dI punched Jem. \u201cHow long\u2019s he been at it?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just gone over the evidence,\u201d Jem whispered, \u201cand we\u2019re gonna win, Scout. I don\u2019t see how we can\u2019t. He\u2019s been at it \u2019bout five minutes. He made it as plain and easy as\u2014well, as I\u2019da explained it to you. You could\u2019ve understood it, even.\u201d\u201cDid Mr. Gilmer\u2014?\u201d\u201cSh-h. Nothing new, just the usual. Hush now.\u201dWe looked down again. Atticus was speaking easily, with the kind of detachment he used when he dictated a letter. He walked slowly up and down in front of the jury, and the jury seemed to be attentive: their heads were up, and they followed Atticus\u2019s route with what seemed to be appreciation. I guess it was because Atticus wasn\u2019t a thunderer.Atticus paused, then he did something he didn\u2019t ordinarily do. He unhitched his watch and chain and placed them on the table, saying, \u201cWith the court\u2019s permission\u2014\u201dJudge Taylor nodded, and then Atticus did something I never saw him do before or since, in public or in private: he unbuttoned his vest, unbuttoned his collar, loosened his tie, and took off his coat. He never loosened a scrap of his clothing until he undressed at bedtime, and to Jem and me, this was the equivalent of him standing before us stark naked. We exchanged horrified glances.Atticus put his hands in his pockets, and as he returned to the jury, I saw his gold collar button and the tips of his pen and pencil winking in the light.\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said. Jem and I again looked at each other: Atticus might have said, \u201cScout.\u201d His voice had lost its aridity, its detachment, and he was talking to the jury as if they were folks on the post office corner.\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI shall be brief, but I would like to use my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one, it requires no minute sifting of complicated facts, but it does require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant. To begin with, this case should never have come to trial. This case is as simple as black and white.\u201cThe state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant. The defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is.\u201cI have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man\u2019s life at stake, which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt.\u201cI say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted, as her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another. She did something every child has done\u2014she tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victim\u2014of necessity she must put him away from her\u2014he must be removed from her presence, from this world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense.\u201cWhat was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cShe was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society is unspeakable: she kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong young Negro man. No code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on her afterwards.\u201cHer father saw it, and the defendant has testified as to his remarks. What did her father do? We don\u2019t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left. We do know in part what Mr. Ewell did: he did what any God-fearing, persevering, respectable white man would do under the circumstances\u2014he swore out a warrant, no doubt signing it with his left hand, and Tom Robinson now sits before you, having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesses\u2014his right hand.\u201cAnd so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to \u2018feel sorry\u2019 for a white woman has had to put his word against two white people\u2019s. I need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand\u2014you saw them for yourselves. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the sheriff of Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted, confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption\u2014the evil assumption\u2014that all Negroes lie, that all Negroes are basically immoral beings, that all Negro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber.\u201cWhich, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie as black as Tom Robinson\u2019s skin, a lie I do not have to point out to you. You know the truth, and the truth is this: some Negroes lie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be trusted around women\u2014black or white. But this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men. There is not a person in this courtroom who has never told a lie, who has never done an immoral thing, and there is no man living who has never looked upon a woman without desire.\u201dAtticus paused and took out his handkerchief. Then he took off his glasses and wiped them, and we saw another \u201cfirst\u201d: we had never seen him sweat\u2014he was one of those men whose faces never perspired, but now it was shining tan.\u201cOne more thing, gentlemen, before I quit. Thomas Jefferson once said that all men are created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the Executive branch in Washington are fond of hurling at us. There is a tendency in this year of grace, 1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to satisfy all conditions. The most ridiculous example I can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious\u2014because all men are created equal, educators will gravely tell you, the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority. We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe\u2014some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they\u2019re born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than others\u2014some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.\u201cBut there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal\u2014there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be the Supreme Court of the United States or the humblest J.P. court in the land, or this honorable court which you serve. Our courts have their faults, as does any human institution, but in this country our courts are the great levelers, and in our courts all men are created equal.\u201cI\u2019m no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury system\u2014that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of God, do your duty.\u201dAtticus\u2019s voice had dropped, and as he turned away from the jury he said something I did not catch. He said it more to himself than to the court. I punched Jem. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d\u201c \u2018In the name of God, believe him,\u2019 I think that\u2019s what he said.\u201dDill suddenly reached over me and tugged at Jem. \u201cLooka yonder!\u201dWe followed his finger with sinking hearts. Calpurnia was making her way up the middle aisle, walking straight toward Atticus.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "21She stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get Judge Taylor\u2019s attention.

It hasn\u2019t got anything to do with\u2014with the trial.\u201dJudge Taylor nodded and Atticus took the envelope from Calpurnia.

I . . . could you\u2014\u201d\u201cI know where they are, Atticus.\u201d Mr. Underwood spoke up. \u201cThey\u2019re right up yonder in the Colored balcony\u2014been there since precisely one-eighteen P.M.\u201dOur father turned around and looked up. \u201cJem, come down from there,\u201d he called. Then he said something to the Judge we didn\u2019t hear. We climbed across Reverend Sykes and made our way to the staircase.Atticus and Calpurnia met us downstairs. Calpurnia looked peeved, but Atticus looked exhausted.Jem was jumping in excitement. \u201cWe\u2019ve won, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve no idea,\u201d said Atticus shortly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here all afternoon? Go home with Calpurnia and get your supper\u2014and stay home.\u201d\u201cAw, Atticus, let us come back,\u201d pleaded Jem. \u201cPlease let us hear the verdict, please sir.\u201d\u201cThe jury might be out and back in a minute, we don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d but we could tell Atticus was relenting. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve heard it all, so you might as well hear the rest. Tell you what, you all can come back when you\u2019ve eaten your supper\u2014eat slowly, now, you won\u2019t miss anything important\u2014and if the jury\u2019s still out, you can wait with us. But I expect it\u2019ll be over before you get back.\u201d\u201cYou think they\u2019ll acquit him that fast?\u201d asked Jem.Atticus opened his mouth to answer, but shut it and left us.I prayed that Reverend Sykes would save our seats for us, but stopped praying when I remembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was out\u2014tonight, they\u2019d overrun the drugstore, the O.K. Caf\u00e9 and the hotel, that is, unless they had brought their suppers too.Calpurnia marched us home: \u201c\u2014skin every one of you alive, the very idea, you children listenin\u2019 to all that! Mister Jem, don\u2019t you know better\u2019n to take your little sister to that trial? Miss Alexandra\u2019ll absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she finds out! Ain\u2019t fittin\u2019 for children to hear. . . .\u201dThe streetlights were on, and we glimpsed Calpurnia\u2019s indignant profile as we passed beneath them. \u201cMister Jem, I thought you was gettin\u2019 some kinda head on your shoulders\u2014the very idea, she\u2019s your little sister! The very idea, sir! You oughta be perfectly ashamed of yourself\u2014ain\u2019t you got any sense at all?\u201dI was exhilarated. So many things had happened so fast I felt it would take years to sort them out, and now here was Calpurnia giving her precious Jem down the country\u2014what new marvels would the evening bring?Jem was chuckling. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear about it, Cal?\u201d\u201cHush your mouth, sir! When you oughta be hangin\u2019 your head in shame you go along laughin\u2019\u2014\u201d Calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved Jem to little remorse, and she sailed up the front steps with her classic, \u201cIf Mr. Finch don\u2019t wear you out, I will\u2014get in that house, sir!\u201dJem went in grinning, and Calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having Dill in to supper. \u201cYou all call Miss Rachel right now and tell her where you are,\u201d she told him. \u201cShe\u2019s run distracted lookin\u2019 for you\u2014you watch out she don\u2019t ship you back to Meridian first thing in the mornin\u2019.\u201dAunt Alexandra met us and nearly fainted when Calpurnia told her where we were. I guess it hurt her when we told her Atticus said we could go back, because she didn\u2019t say a word during supper. She just rearranged food on her plate, looking at it sadly while Calpurnia served Jem, Dill and me with a vengeance. Calpurnia poured milk, dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, \u201c \u2019shamed of yourselves,\u201d in varying degrees of intensity. \u201cNow you all eat slow,\u201d was her final command.Reverend Sykes had saved our places. We were surprised to find that we had been gone nearly an hour, and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly as we had left it, with minor changes: the jury box was empty, the defendant was gone; Judge Taylor had been gone, but he reappeared as we were seating ourselves.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cNobody\u2019s moved, hardly,\u201d said Jem.\u201cThey moved around some when the jury went out,\u201d said Reverend Sykes. \u201cThe menfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers, and they fed their babies.\u201d\u201cHow long have they been out?\u201d asked Jem.\u201c \u2019bout thirty minutes. Mr. Finch and Mr. Gilmer did some more talkin\u2019, and Judge Taylor charged the jury.\u201d\u201cHow was he?\u201d asked Jem.\u201cWhat say? Oh, he did right well. I ain\u2019t complainin\u2019 one bit\u2014he was mighty fair-minded. He sorta said if you believe this, then you\u2019ll have to return one verdict, but if you believe this, you\u2019ll have to return another one. I thought he was leanin\u2019 a little to our side\u2014\u201d Reverend Sykes scratched his head.Jem smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s not supposed to lean, Reverend, but don\u2019t fret, we\u2019ve won it,\u201d he said wisely. \u201cDon\u2019t see how any jury could convict on what we heard\u2014\u201d\u201cNow don\u2019t you be so confident, Mr. Jem, I ain\u2019t ever seen any jury decide in favor of a colored man over a white man. . . .\u201d But Jem took exception to Reverend Sykes, and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with Jem\u2019s ideas on the law regarding rape: it wasn\u2019t rape if she let you, but she had to be eighteen\u2014in Alabama, that is\u2014and Mayella was nineteen. Apparently you had to kick and holler, you had to be overpowered and stomped on, preferably knocked stone cold. If you were under eighteen, you didn\u2019t have to go through all this.\u201cMr. Jem,\u201d Reverend Sykes demurred, \u201cthis ain\u2019t a polite thing for little ladies to hear . . .\u201d\u201cAw, she doesn\u2019t know what we\u2019re talkin\u2019 about,\u201d said Jem. \u201cScout, this is too old for you, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt most certainly is not, I know every word you\u2019re saying.\u201d Perhaps I was too convincing, because Jem hushed and never discussed the subject again.\u201cWhat time is it, Reverend?\u201d he asked.\u201cGettin\u2019 on toward eight.\u201dI looked down and saw Atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box. He looked in it, inspected Judge Taylor on his throne, then went back to where he started. I caught his eye and waved to him. He acknowledged my salute with a nod, and resumed his tour.Mr. Gilmer was standing at the windows talking to Mr. Underwood. Bert, the court reporter, was chain-smoking: he sat back with his feet on the table.But the officers of the court, the ones present\u2014Atticus, Mr. Gilmer, Judge Taylor sound asleep, and Bert, were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal. I had never seen a packed courtroom so still. Sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully, and a child would scurry out, but the grown people sat as if they were in church. In the balcony, the Negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience.The old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck the hour, eight deafening bongs that shook our bones.When it bonged eleven times I was past feeling: tired from fighting sleep, I allowed myself a short nap against Reverend Sykes\u2019s comfortable arm and shoulder. I jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so, by looking down and concentrating on the heads below: there were sixteen bald ones, fourteen men that could pass for red-heads, forty heads varying between brown and black, and\u2014I remembered something Jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period of physical research: he said if enough people\u2014a stadium full, maybe\u2014were to concentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the woods, that the tree would ignite of its own accord. I toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrate on setting Tom Robinson free, but thought if they were as tired as I, it wouldn\u2019t work.Dill was sound asleep, his head on Jem\u2019s shoulder, and Jem was quiet.\u201cAin\u2019t it a long time?\u201d I asked him.\u201cSure is, Scout,\u201d he said happily.\u201cWell, from the way you put it, it\u2019d just take five minutes.\u201dJem raised his eyebrows. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, and I was too weary to argue.But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have received the impression that was creeping into me. It was not unlike one I had last winter, and I shivered, though the night was hot. The feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the same as a cold February morning, when the mockingbirds were still, and the carpenters had stopped hammering on Miss Maudie\u2019s new house, and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the Radley Place. A deserted, waiting, empty street, and the courtroom was packed with people. A steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning. Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the courtroom and was talking to Atticus, might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket. Atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, \u201cTake him, Mr. Finch. . . .\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "But Mr. Tate said, \u201cThis court will come to order,\u201d in a voice that rang with authority, and the heads below us jerked up. Mr. Tate left the room and returned with Tom Robinson. He steered Tom to his place beside Atticus, and stood there. Judge Taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight, looking at the empty jury box.What happened after that had a dreamlike quality: in a dream I saw the jury return, moving like underwater swimmers, and Judge Taylor\u2019s voice came from far away, and was tiny. I saw something only a lawyer\u2019s child could be expected to see, could be expected to watch for, and it was like watching Atticus walk into the street, raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger, but watching all the time knowing that the gun was empty.A jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted, and when this jury came in, not one of them looked at Tom Robinson. The foreman handed a piece of paper to Mr. Tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judge. . . .I shut my eyes. Judge Taylor was polling the jury: \u201cGuilty . . . guilty . . . guilty . . . guilty . . .\u201d I peeked at Jem: his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail, and his shoulders jerked as if each \u201cguilty\u201d was a separate stab between them.Judge Taylor was saying something. His gavel was in his fist, but he wasn\u2019t using it. Dimly, I saw Atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase. He snapped it shut, went to the court reporter and said something, nodded to Mr. Gilmer, and then went to Tom Robinson and whispered something to him. Atticus put his hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder as he whispered. Atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder. Then he left the courtroom, but not by his usual exit. He must have wanted to go home the short way, because he walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. I followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door. He did not look up.Someone was punching me, but I was reluctant to take my eyes from the people below us, and from the image of Atticus\u2019s lonely walk down the aisle.\u201cMiss Jean Louise?\u201dI looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony on the opposite wall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend Sykes\u2019s voice was as distant as Judge Taylor\u2019s:\u201cMiss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father\u2019s passin\u2019.\u201d22It was Jem\u2019s turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right,\u201d he muttered, all the way to the corner of the square where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the street light looking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned, his collar and tie were neatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his impassive self again.\u201cIt ain\u2019t right, Atticus,\u201d said Jem.\u201cNo son, it\u2019s not right.\u201dWe walked home.Aunt Alexandra was waiting up. She was in her dressing gown, and I could have sworn she had on her corset underneath it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, brother,\u201d she murmured. Having never heard her call Atticus \u201cbrother\u201d before, I stole a glance at Jem, but he was not listening. He would look up at Atticus, then down at the floor, and I wondered if he thought Atticus somehow responsible for Tom Robinson\u2019s conviction.\u201cIs he all right?\u201d Aunty asked, indicating Jem.\u201cHe\u2019ll be so presently,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cIt was a little too strong for him.\u201d Our father sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t wake up in the morning, don\u2019t call me.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think it wise in the first place to let them\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is their home, sister,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it this way for them, they might as well learn to cope with it.\u201d\u201cBut they don\u2019t have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just as much Maycomb County as missionary teas.\u201d\u201cAtticus\u2014\u201d Aunt Alexandra\u2019s eyes were anxious. \u201cYou are the last person I thought would turn bitter over this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not bitter, just tired. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\u201cAtticus\u2014\u201d said Jem bleakly.He turned in the doorway. \u201cWhat, son?\u201d\u201cHow could they do it, how could they?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but they did it. They\u2019ve done it before and they did it tonight and they\u2019ll do it again and when they do it\u2014seems that only children weep. Good night.\u201dBut things are always better in the morning. Atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour and was in the livingroom behind The Mobile Register when we stumbled in. Jem\u2019s morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not time to worry yet,\u201d Atticus reassured him, as we went to the diningroom. \u201cWe\u2019re not through yet. There\u2019ll be an appeal, you can count on that. Gracious alive, Cal, what\u2019s all this?\u201d He was staring at his breakfast plate.Calpurnia said, \u201cTom Robinson\u2019s daddy sent you along this chicken this morning. I fixed it.\u201d\u201cYou tell him I\u2019m proud to get it\u2014bet they don\u2019t have chicken for breakfast at the White House. What are these?\u201d\u201cRolls,\u201d said Calpurnia. \u201cEstelle down at the hotel sent \u2019em.\u201dAtticus looked up at her, puzzled, and she said, \u201cYou better step out here and see what\u2019s in the kitchen, Mr. Finch.\u201dWe followed him. The kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the family: hunks of salt pork, tomatoes, beans, even scuppernongs. Atticus grinned when he found a jar of pickled pigs\u2019 knuckles. \u201cReckon Aunty\u2019ll let me eat these in the diningroom?\u201dCalpurnia said, \u201cThis was all \u2019round the back steps when I got here this morning. They\u2014they \u2019preciate what you did, Mr. Finch. They\u2014they aren\u2019t oversteppin\u2019 themselves, are they?\u201dAtticus\u2019s eyes filled with tears. He did not speak for a moment. \u201cTell them I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cTell them\u2014tell them they must never do this again. Times are too hard. . . .\u201dHe left the kitchen, went in the diningroom and excused himself to Aunt Alexandra, put on his hat and went to town.We heard Dill\u2019s step in the hall, so Calpurnia left Atticus\u2019s uneaten breakfast on the table. Between rabbit-bites Dill told us of Miss Rachel\u2019s reaction to last night, which was: if a man like Atticus Finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall it\u2019s his head.\u201cI\u2019da got her told,\u201d growled Dill, gnawing a chicken leg, \u201cbut she didn\u2019t look much like tellin\u2019 this morning. Said she was up half the night wonderin\u2019 where I was, said she\u2019da had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing.\u201d\u201cDill, you\u2019ve got to stop goin\u2019 off without tellin\u2019 her,\u201d said Jem. \u201cIt just aggravates her.\u201dDill sighed patiently. \u201cI told her till I was blue in the face where I was goin\u2019\u2014she\u2019s just seein\u2019 too many snakes in the closet. But that woman drinks a pint for breakfast every morning\u2014know she drinks two glasses full. Seen her.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, Dill,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra. \u201cIt\u2019s not becoming to a child. It\u2019s\u2014cynical.\u201d\u201cI ain\u2019t cynical, Miss Alexandra. Tellin\u2019 the truth\u2019s not cynical, is it?\u201d\u201cThe way you tell it, it is.\u201dJem\u2019s eyes flashed at her, but he said to Dill, \u201cLet\u2019s go. You can take that runner with you.\u201dWhen we went to the front porch, Miss Stephanie Crawford was busy telling it to Miss Maudie Atkinson and Mr. Avery. They looked around at us and went on talking. Jem made a feral noise in his throat. I wished for a weapon.\u201cI hate grown folks lookin\u2019 at you,\u201d said Dill. \u201cMakes you feel like you\u2019ve done something.\u201dMiss Maudie yelled for Jem Finch to come there.Jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Dill said.Miss Stephanie\u2019s nose quivered with curiosity. She wanted to know who all gave us permission to go to court\u2014she didn\u2019t see us but it was all over town this morning that we were in the Colored balcony. Did Atticus put us up there as a sort of\u2014? Wasn\u2019t it right close up there with all those\u2014? Did Scout understand all the\u2014? Didn\u2019t it make us mad to see our daddy beat?\u201cHush, Stephanie.\u201d Miss Maudie\u2019s diction was deadly. \u201cI\u2019ve not got all the morning to pass on the porch\u2014Jem Finch, I called to find out if you and your colleagues can eat some cake. Got up at five to make it, so you better say yes. Excuse us, Stephanie. Good morning, Mr. Avery.\u201dThere was a big cake and two little ones on Miss Maudie\u2019s kitchen table. There should have been three little ones. It was not like Miss Maudie to forget Dill, and we must have shown it. But we understood when she cut from the big cake and gave the slice to Jem.As we ate, we sensed that this was Miss Maudie\u2019s way of saying that as far as she was concerned, nothing had changed. She sat quietly in a kitchen chair, watching us.Suddenly she spoke: \u201cDon\u2019t fret, Jem. Things are never as bad as they seem.\u201dIndoors, when Miss Maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her fingers on her knees and settled her bridgework. This she did, and we waited.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cI simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your father\u2019s one of them.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWell.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you oh well me, sir,\u201d Miss Maudie replied, recognizing Jem\u2019s fatalistic noises, \u201cyou are not old enough to appreciate what I said.\u201dJem was staring at his half-eaten cake. \u201cIt\u2019s like bein\u2019 a caterpillar in a cocoon, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cLike somethin\u2019 asleep wrapped up in a warm place. I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that\u2019s what they seemed like.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re the safest folks in the world,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cWe\u2019re so rarely called on to be Christians, but when we are, we\u2019ve got men like Atticus to go for us.\u201dJem grinned ruefully. \u201cWish the rest of the county thought that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many of us do.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Jem\u2019s voice rose. \u201cWho in this town did one thing to help Tom Robinson, just who?\u201d\u201cHis colored friends for one thing, and people like us. People like Judge Taylor. People like Mr. Heck Tate. Stop eating and start thinking, Jem. Did it ever strike you that Judge Taylor naming Atticus to defend that boy was no accident? That Judge Taylor might have had his reasons for naming him?\u201dThis was a thought. Court-appointed defenses were usually given to Maxwell Green, Maycomb\u2019s latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience. Maxwell Green should have had Tom Robinson\u2019s case.\u201cYou think about that,\u201d Miss Maudie was saying. \u201cIt was no accident. I was sittin\u2019 there on the porch last night, waiting. I waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk, and as I waited I thought, Atticus Finch won\u2019t win, he can\u2019t win, but he\u2019s the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that. And I thought to myself, well, we\u2019re making a step\u2014it\u2019s just a baby-step, but it\u2019s a step.\u201d\u201c\u2019t\u2019s all right to talk like that\u2014can\u2019t any Christian judges an\u2019 lawyers make up for heathen juries,\u201d Jem muttered. \u201cSoon\u2019s I get grown\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to take up with your father,\u201d Miss Maudie said.We went down Miss Maudie\u2019s cool new steps into the sunshine and found Mr. Avery and Miss Stephanie Crawford still at it. They had moved down the sidewalk and were standing in front of Miss Stephanie\u2019s house. Miss Rachel was walking toward them.\u201cI think I\u2019ll be a clown when I get grown,\u201d said Dill.Jem and I stopped in our tracks.\u201cYes sir, a clown,\u201d he said. \u201cThere ain\u2019t one thing in this world I can do about folks except laugh, so I\u2019m gonna join the circus and laugh my head off.\u201d\u201cYou got it backwards, Dill,\u201d said Jem. \u201cClowns are sad, it\u2019s folks that laugh at them.\u201d\u201cWell I\u2019m gonna be a new kind of clown. I\u2019m gonna stand in the middle of the ring and laugh at the folks. Just looka yonder,\u201d he pointed. \u201cEvery one of \u2019em oughta be ridin\u2019 broomsticks. Aunt Rachel already does.\u201dMiss Stephanie and Miss Rachel were waving wildly at us, in a way that did not give the lie to Dill\u2019s observation.\u201cOh gosh,\u201d breathed Jem. \u201cI reckon it\u2019d be ugly not to see \u2019em.\u201dSomething was wrong. Mr. Avery was red in the face from a sneezing spell and nearly blew us off the sidewalk when we came up. Miss Stephanie was trembling with excitement, and Miss Rachel caught Dill\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou get on in the back yard and stay there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s danger a\u2019comin\u2019.\u201d\u201c \u2019s matter?\u201d I asked.\u201cAin\u2019t you heard yet? It\u2019s all over town\u2014\u201dAt that moment Aunt Alexandra came to the door and called us, but she was too late. It was Miss Stephanie\u2019s pleasure to tell us: this morning Mr. Bob Ewell stopped Atticus on the post office corner, spat in his face, and told him he\u2019d get him if it took the rest of his life.23\u201cI wish Bob Ewell wouldn\u2019t chew tobacco,\u201d was all Atticus said about it. According to Miss Stephanie Crawford, however, Atticus was leaving the post office when Mr. Ewell approached him, cursed him, spat on him, and threatened to kill him. Miss Stephanie (who, by the time she had told it twice was there and had seen it all\u2014passing by from the Jitney Jungle, she was)\u2014Miss Stephanie said Atticus didn\u2019t bat an eye, just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let Mr. Ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to repeat. Mr. Ewell was a veteran of an obscure war; that plus Atticus\u2019s peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire, \u201cToo proud to fight, you nigger-lovin\u2019 bastard?\u201d Miss Stephanie said Atticus said, \u201cNo, too old,\u201d put his hands in his pockets and strolled on. Miss Stephanie said you had to hand it to Atticus Finch, he could be right dry sometimes.\n</p>\n</div>"},

He could\u2014\u201d\u201cYou know he wouldn\u2019t carry a gun, Scout. He ain\u2019t even got one\u2014\u201d said Jem. \u201cYou know he didn\u2019t even have one down at the jail that night. He told me havin\u2019 a gun around\u2019s an invitation to somebody to shoot you.\u201d\u201cThis is different,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can ask him to borrow one.\u201dWe did, and he said, \u201cNonsense.\u201dDill was of the opinion that an appeal to Atticus\u2019s better nature might work: after all, we would starve if Mr. Ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by Aunt Alexandra, and we all knew the first thing she\u2019d do before Atticus was under the ground good would be to fire Calpurnia. Jem said it might work if I cried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn\u2019t work either.But when he noticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in our normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He tempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the pages and toss it aside, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, son?\u201dJem came to the point: \u201cMr. Ewell.\u201d\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019s happened. We\u2019re scared for you, and we think you oughta do something about him.\u201dAtticus smiled wryly. \u201cDo what? Put him under a peace bond?\u201d\u201cWhen a man says he\u2019s gonna get you, looks like he means it.\u201d\u201cHe meant it when he said it,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cJem, see if you can stand in Bob Ewell\u2019s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he had any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind always does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that\u2019s something I\u2019ll gladly take. He had to take it out on somebody and I\u2019d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You understand?\u201dJem nodded.Aunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure of that, Atticus,\u201d she said. \u201cHis kind\u2019d do anything to pay off a grudge. You know how those people are.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth could Ewell do to me, sister?\u201d\u201cSomething furtive,\u201d Aunt Alexandra said. \u201cYou may count on that.\u201d\u201cNobody has much chance to be furtive in Maycomb,\u201d Atticus answered.After that, we were not afraid. Summer was melting away, and we made the most of it. Atticus assured us that nothing would happen to Tom Robinson until the higher court reviewed his case, and that Tom had a good chance of going free, or at least of having a new trial. He was at Enfield Prison Farm, seventy miles away in Chester County. I asked Atticus if Tom\u2019s wife and children were allowed to visit him, but Atticus said no.\u201cIf he loses his appeal,\u201d I asked one evening, \u201cwhat\u2019ll happen to him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll go to the chair,\u201d said Atticus, \u201cunless the Governor commutes his sentence. Not time to worry yet, Scout. We\u2019ve got a good chance.\u201dJem was sprawled on the sofa reading Popular Mechanics. He looked up. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right. He didn\u2019t kill anybody even if he was guilty. He didn\u2019t take anybody\u2019s life.\u201d\u201cYou know rape\u2019s a capital offense in Alabama,\u201d said Atticus.\u201cYessir, but the jury didn\u2019t have to give him death\u2014if they wanted to they could\u2019ve gave him twenty years.\u201d\u201cGiven,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cTom Robinson\u2019s a colored man, Jem. No jury in this part of the world\u2019s going to say, \u2018We think you\u2019re guilty, but not very,\u2019 on a charge like that. It was either a straight acquittal or nothing.\u201dJem was shaking his head. \u201cI know it\u2019s not right, but I can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong\u2014maybe rape shouldn\u2019t be a capital offense. . . .\u201dAtticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. He said he didn\u2019t have any quarrel with the rape statute, none whatever, but he did have deep misgivings when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence. He glanced at me, saw I was listening, and made it easier. \u201cI mean, before a man is sentenced to death for murder, say, there should be one or two eyewitnesses. Someone should be able to say, \u2018Yes, I was there and saw him pull the trigger.\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cBut lots of folks have been hung\u2014hanged\u2014on circumstantial evidence,\u201d said Jem.\u201cI know, and lots of \u2019em probably deserved it, too\u2014but in the absence of eyewitnesses there\u2019s always a doubt, sometimes only the shadow of a doubt. The law says \u2018reasonable doubt,\u2019 but I think a defendant\u2019s entitled to the shadow of a doubt. There\u2019s always the possibility, no matter how improbable, that he\u2019s innocent.\u201d\u201cThen it all goes back to the jury, then. We oughta do away with juries.\u201d Jem was adamant.Atticus tried hard not to smile but couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou\u2019re rather hard on us, son. I think maybe there might be a better way. Change the law. Change it so that only judges have the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases.\u201d\u201cThen go up to Montgomery and change the law.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how hard that\u2019d be. I won\u2019t live to see the law changed, and if you live to see it you\u2019ll be an old man.\u201dThis was not good enough for Jem. \u201cNo sir, they oughta do away with juries. He wasn\u2019t guilty in the first place and they said he was.\u201d\u201cIf you had been on that jury, son, and eleven other boys like you, Tom would be a free man,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cSo far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoning process. Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom\u2019s jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. You saw the same thing that night in front of the jail. When that crew went away, they didn\u2019t go as reasonable men, they went because we were there. There\u2019s something in our world that makes men lose their heads\u2014they couldn\u2019t be fair if they tried. In our courts, when it\u2019s a white man\u2019s word against a black man\u2019s, the white man always wins. They\u2019re ugly, but those are the facts of life.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d said Jem stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. \u201cYou just can\u2019t convict a man on evidence like that\u2014you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t, but they could and did. The older you grow the more of it you\u2019ll see. The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box. As you grow older, you\u2019ll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don\u2019t you forget it\u2014whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash.\u201dAtticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears. I looked up, and his face was vehement. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more sickening to me than a low-grade white man who\u2019ll take advantage of a Negro\u2019s ignorance. Don\u2019t fool yourselves\u2014it\u2019s all adding up and one of these days we\u2019re going to pay the bill for it. I hope it\u2019s not in you children\u2019s time.\u201dJem was scratching his head. Suddenly his eyes widened. \u201cAtticus,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t people like us and Miss Maudie ever sit on juries? You never see anybody from Maycomb on a jury\u2014they all come from out in the woods.\u201dAtticus leaned back in his rocking-chair. For some reason he looked pleased with Jem. \u201cI was wondering when that\u2019d occur to you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of reasons. For one thing, Miss Maudie can\u2019t serve on a jury because she\u2019s a woman\u2014\u201d\u201cYou mean women in Alabama can\u2019t\u2014?\u201d I was indignant.\u201cI do. I guess it\u2019s to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Tom\u2019s. Besides,\u201d Atticus grinned, \u201cI doubt if we\u2019d ever get a complete case tried\u2014the ladies\u2019d be interrupting to ask questions.\u201dJem and I laughed. Miss Maudie on a jury would be impressive. I thought of old Mrs. Dubose in her wheelchair\u2014\u201cStop that rapping, John Taylor, I want to ask this man something.\u201d Perhaps our forefathers were wise.Atticus was saying, \u201cWith people like us\u2014that\u2019s our share of the bill. We generally get the juries we deserve. Our stout Maycomb citizens aren\u2019t interested, in the first place. In the second place, they\u2019re afraid. Then, they\u2019re\u2014\u201d\u201cAfraid, why?\u201d asked Jem.\u201cWell, what if\u2014say, Mr. Link Deas had to decide the amount of damages to award, say, Miss Maudie, when Miss Rachel ran over her with a car. Link wouldn\u2019t like the thought of losing either lady\u2019s business at his store, would he? So he tells Judge Taylor that he can\u2019t serve on the jury because he doesn\u2019t have anybody to keep store for him while he\u2019s gone. So Judge Taylor excuses him. Sometimes he excuses him wrathfully.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019d make him think either one of \u2019em\u2019d stop trading with him?\u201d I asked.Jem said, \u201cMiss Rachel would, Miss Maudie wouldn\u2019t. But a jury\u2019s vote\u2019s secret, Atticus.\u201dOur father chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve many more miles to go, son. A jury\u2019s vote\u2019s supposed to be secret. Serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and declare himself about something. Men don\u2019t like to do that. Sometimes it\u2019s unpleasant.\u201d\u201cTom\u2019s jury sho\u2019 made up its mind in a hurry,\u201d Jem muttered.Atticus\u2019s fingers went to his watchpocket. \u201cNo it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, more to himself than to us. \u201cThat was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours. An inevitable verdict, maybe, but usually it takes \u2019em just a few minutes. This time\u2014\u201d he broke off and looked at us. \u201cYou might like to know that there was one fellow who took considerable wearing down\u2014in the beginning he was rarin\u2019 for an outright acquittal.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Jem was astonished.Atticus\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to say, but I\u2019ll tell you this much. He was one of your Old Sarum friends . . .\u201d\u201cOne of the Cunninghams?\u201d Jem yelped. \u201cOne of\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize any of \u2019em . . . you\u2019re jokin\u2019.\u201d He looked at Atticus from the corners of his eyes.\u201cOne of their connections. On a hunch, I didn\u2019t strike him. Just on a hunch. Could\u2019ve, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cGolly Moses,\u201d Jem said reverently. \u201cOne minute they\u2019re tryin\u2019 to kill him and the next they\u2019re tryin\u2019 to turn him loose . . . I\u2019ll never understand those folks as long as I live.\u201dAtticus said you just had to know \u2019em. He said the Cunninghams hadn\u2019t taken anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the New World. He said the other thing about them was, once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail. Atticus said he had a feeling, nothing more than a suspicion, that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the Finches. Then too, he said, it took a thunderbolt plus another Cunningham to make one of them change his mind. \u201cIf we\u2019d had two of that crowd, we\u2019d\u2019ve had a hung jury.\u201dJem said slowly, \u201cYou mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before? How could you take such a risk, Atticus, how could you?\u201d\u201cWhen you analyze it, there was little risk. There\u2019s no difference between one man who\u2019s going to convict and another man who\u2019s going to convict, is there? There\u2019s a faint difference between a man who\u2019s going to convict and a man who\u2019s a little disturbed in his mind, isn\u2019t there? He was the only uncertainty on the whole list.\u201d\u201cWhat kin was that man to Mr. Walter Cunningham?\u201d I asked.Atticus rose, stretched and yawned. It was not even our bedtime, but we knew he wanted a chance to read his newspaper. He picked it up, folded it, and tapped my head. \u201cLet\u2019s see now,\u201d he droned to himself. \u201cI\u2019ve got it. Double first cousin.\u201d\u201cHow can that be?\u201d\u201cTwo sisters married two brothers. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll tell you\u2014you figure it out.\u201dI tortured myself and decided that if I married Jem and Dill had a sister whom he married our children would be double first cousins. \u201cGee minetti, Jem,\u201d I said, when Atticus had gone, \u201cthey\u2019re funny folks. \u2019d you hear that, Aunty?\u201cAunt Alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us, but she was listening. She sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it, her rug spread across her lap. Why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me.\u201cI heard it,\u201d she said.I remembered the distant disastrous occasion when I rushed to young Walter Cunningham\u2019s defense. Now, I was glad I\u2019d done it. \u201cSoon\u2019s school starts I\u2019m gonna ask Walter home to dinner,\u201d I planned, having forgotten my private resolve to beat him up the next time I saw him. \u201cHe can stay over sometimes after school, too. Atticus could drive him back to Old Sarum. Maybe he could spend the night with us sometime, okay, Jem?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was always a threat, never a promise. Surprised, I turned to her. \u201cWhy not, Aunty? They\u2019re good folks.\u201dShe looked at me over her sewing glasses. \u201cJean Louise, there is no doubt in my mind that they\u2019re good folks. But they\u2019re not our kind of folks.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem says, \u201cShe means they\u2019re yappy, Scout.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a yap?\u201d\u201cAw, tacky.

Besides, there\u2019s a drinking streak in that family a mile wide. Finch women aren\u2019t interested in that sort of people.\u201d\u201cAun-ty,\u201d said Jem, \u201cshe ain\u2019t nine yet.\u201d\u201cShe may as well learn it now.\u201dAunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put her foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit Calpurnia\u2019s house\u2014I was curious, interested; I wanted to be her \u201ccompany,\u201d to see how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the other side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandra\u2019s aim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us\u2014to help us choose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: \u201cIf they\u2019re good folks, then why can\u2019t I be nice to Walter?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you should be gracious to everybody, dear. But you don\u2019t have to invite him home.\u201d\u201cWhat if he was kin to us, Aunty?\u201d\u201cThe fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same.\u201d\u201cAunty,\u201d Jem spoke up, \u201cAtticus says you can choose your friends but you sho\u2019 can\u2019t choose your family, an\u2019 they\u2019re still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge \u2019em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s your father all over again,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra, \u201cand I still say that Jean Louise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he comes to see Atticus on business. Now that is that.\u201dShe had said Indeed Not, but this time she would give her reasons: \u201cBut I want to play with Walter, Aunty, why can\u2019t I?\u201dShe took off her glasses and stared at me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause\u2014he\u2014is\u2014trash, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t play with him. I\u2019ll not have you around him, picking up his habits and learning Lord-knows-what. You\u2019re enough of a problem to your father as it is.\u201dI don\u2019t know what I would have done, but Jem stopped me. He caught me by the shoulders, put his arm around me, and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom. Atticus heard us and poked his head around the door. \u201c \u2019s all right, sir,\u201d Jem said gruffly, \u201c \u2019s not anything.\u201d Atticus went away.\u201cHave a chew, Scout.\u201d Jem dug into his pocket and extracted a Tootsie Roll. It took a few minutes to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw.Jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser. His hair stuck up behind and down in front, and I wondered if it would ever look like a man\u2019s\u2014maybe if he shaved it off and started over, his hair would grow back neatly in place. His eyebrows were becoming heavier, and I noticed a new slimness about his body. He was growing taller.When he looked around, he must have thought I would start crying again, for he said, \u201cShow you something if you won\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d I said what. He unbuttoned his shirt, grinning shyly.\u201cWell what?\u201d\u201cWell can\u2019t you see it?\u201d\u201cWell no.\u201d\u201cWell it\u2019s hair.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cThere. Right there.\u201dHe had been a comfort to me, so I said it looked lovely, but I didn\u2019t see anything. \u201cIt\u2019s real nice, Jem.\u201d\u201cUnder my arms, too,\u201d he said. \u201cGoin\u2019 out for football next year. Scout, don\u2019t let Aunty aggravate you.\u201dIt seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate Aunty.\u201cYou know she\u2019s not used to girls,\u201d said Jem, \u201cleastways, not girls like you. She\u2019s trying to make you a lady. Can\u2019t you take up sewin\u2019 or somethin\u2019?\u201d\u201cHell no. She doesn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s all there is to it, and I don\u2019t care. It was her callin\u2019 Walter Cunningham trash that got me goin\u2019, Jem, not what she said about me being a problem to Atticus. We got that all straight one time, I asked him if I was a problem and he said not much of one, at most one that he could always figure out, and not to worry my head a second about botherin\u2019 him. Naw, it was Walter\u2014that boy\u2019s not trash, Jem. He ain\u2019t like the Ewells.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. He propped himself against a pillow and switched on the reading light. \u201cYou know something, Scout? I\u2019ve got it all figured out, now. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot lately and I\u2019ve got it figured out. There\u2019s four kinds of folks in the world. There\u2019s the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, there\u2019s the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.\u201d\u201cWhat about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County?\u201d\u201cI mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks don\u2019t like the Cunninghams, the Cunninghams don\u2019t like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate and despise the colored folks.\u201dI told Jem if that was so, then why didn\u2019t Tom\u2019s jury, made up of folks like the Cunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells?Jem waved my question away as being infantile.\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Atticus pat his foot when there\u2019s fiddlin\u2019 on the radio, and he loves pot liquor better\u2019n any man I ever saw\u2014\u201d\u201cThen that makes us like the Cunninghams,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t see why Aunty\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, lemme finish\u2014it does, but we\u2019re still different somehow. Atticus said one time the reason Aunty\u2019s so hipped on the family is because all we\u2019ve got\u2019s background and not a dime to our names.\u201d\u201cWell Jem, I don\u2019t know\u2014Atticus told me one time that most of this Old Family stuff\u2019s foolishness because everybody\u2019s family\u2019s just as old as everybody else\u2019s. I said did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes.\u201d\u201cBackground doesn\u2019t mean Old Family,\u201d said Jem. \u201cI think it\u2019s how long your family\u2019s been readin\u2019 and writin\u2019. Scout, I\u2019ve studied this real hard and that\u2019s the only reason I can think of. Somewhere along when the Finches were in Egypt one of \u2019em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy.\u201d Jem laughed. \u201cImagine Aunty being proud her great-grandaddy could read an\u2019 write\u2014ladies pick funny things to be proud of.\u201d\u201cWell I\u2019m glad he could, or who\u2019da taught Atticus and them, and if Atticus couldn\u2019t read, you and me\u2019d be in a fix. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what background is, Jem.\u201d\u201cWell then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter can hardly sign his name, I\u2019ve seen him. We\u2019ve just been readin\u2019 and writin\u2019 longer\u2019n they have.\u201d\u201cNo, everybody\u2019s gotta learn, nobody\u2019s born knowin\u2019. That Walter\u2019s as smart as he can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy. Nothin\u2019s wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there\u2019s just one kind of folks. Folks.\u201dJem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was cloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came together; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too,\u201d he said at last, \u201cwhen I was your age. If there\u2019s just one kind of folks, why can\u2019t they get along with each other? If they\u2019re all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I\u2019m beginning to understand something. I think I\u2019m beginning to understand why Boo Radley\u2019s stayed shut up in the house all this time . . . it\u2019s because he wants to stay inside.\u201d24Calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron. She carried a tray of charlotte. She backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently. I admired the ease and grace with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things. So did Aunt Alexandra, I guess, because she had let Calpurnia serve today.August was on the brink of September. Dill would be leaving for Meridian tomorrow; today he was off with Jem at Barker\u2019s Eddy. Jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach Dill how to swim, a skill Jem considered necessary as walking. They had spent two afternoons at the creek, they said they were going in naked and I couldn\u2019t come, so I divided the lonely hours between Calpurnia and Miss Maudie.Today Aunt Alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all over the house. From the kitchen, I heard Mrs. Grace Merriweather giving a report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the Mrunas, it sounded like to me. They put the women out in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they had no sense of family\u2014I knew that\u2019d distress Aunty\u2014they subjected children to terrible ordeals when they were thirteen; they were crawling with yaws and earworms, they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Immediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments.I didn\u2019t know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. Aunt Alexandra told me to join them for refreshments; it was not necessary that I attend the business part of the meeting, she said it\u2019d bore me. I was wearing my pink Sunday dress, shoes, and a petticoat, and reflected that if I spilled anything Calpurnia would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow. This had been a busy day for her. I decided to stay out.\u201cCan I help you, Cal?\u201d I asked, wishing to be of some service.Calpurnia paused in the doorway. \u201cYou be still as a mouse in that corner,\u201d she said, \u201can\u2019 you can help me load up the trays when I come back.\u201dThe gentle hum of ladies\u2019 voices grew louder as she opened the door: \u201cWhy, Alexandra, I never saw such charlotte . . . just lovely . . . I never can get my crust like this, never can . . . who\u2019d\u2019ve thought of little dewberry tarts . . . Calpurnia? . . . who\u2019da thought it . . . anybody tell you that the preacher\u2019s wife\u2019s . . . no-oo, well she is, and that other one not walkin\u2019 yet. . . .\u201dThey became quiet, and I knew they had all been served. Calpurnia returned and put my mother\u2019s heavy silver pitcher on a tray. \u201cThis coffee pitcher\u2019s a curiosity,\u201d she murmured, \u201cthey don\u2019t make \u2019em these days.\u201d\u201cCan I carry it in?\u201d\u201cIf you be careful and don\u2019t drop it. Set it down at the end of the table by Miss Alexandra. Down there by the cups\u2019n things. She\u2019s gonna pour.\u201dI tried pressing my behind against the door as Calpurnia had done, but the door didn\u2019t budge. Grinning, she held it open for me. \u201cCareful now, it\u2019s heavy. Don\u2019t look at it and you won\u2019t spill it.\u201dMy journey was successful: Aunt Alexandra smiled brilliantly. \u201cStay with us, Jean Louise,\u201d she said. This was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady.It was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for refreshments, be they Baptists or Presbyterians, which accounted for the presence of Miss Rachel (sober as a judge), Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Rather nervous, I took a seat beside Miss Maudie and wondered why ladies put on their hats to go across the street. Ladies in bunches always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere, but this feeling was what Aunt Alexandra called being \u201cspoiled.\u201dThe ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints: most of them were heavily powdered but unrouged; the only lipstick in the room was Tangee Natural. Cutex Natural sparkled on their fingernails, but some of the younger ladies wore Rose. They smelled heavenly. I sat quietly, having conquered my hands by tightly gripping the arms of the chair, and waited for someone to speak to me.Miss Maudie\u2019s gold bridgework twinkled. \u201cYou\u2019re mighty dressed up, Miss Jean Louise,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are your britches today?\u201d\u201cUnder my dress.\u201dI hadn\u2019t meant to be funny, but the ladies laughed. My cheeks grew hot as I realized my mistake, but Miss Maudie looked gravely down at me. She never laughed at me unless I meant to be funny.In the sudden silence that followed, Miss Stephanie Crawford called from across the room, \u201cWhatcha going to be when you grow up, Jean Louise? A lawyer?\u201d\u201cNome, I hadn\u2019t thought about it . . .\u201d I answered, grateful that Miss Stephanie was kind enough to change the subject. Hurriedly I began choosing my vocation. Nurse? Aviator? \u201cWell . . .\u201d\u201cWhy shoot, I thought you wanted to be a lawyer, you\u2019ve already commenced going to court.\u201dThe ladies laughed again. \u201cThat Stephanie\u2019s a card,\u201d somebody said. Miss Stephanie was encouraged to pursue the subject: \u201cDon\u2019t you want to grow up to be a lawyer?\u201dMiss Maudie\u2019s hand touched mine and I answered mildly enough, \u201cNome, just a lady.\u201dMiss Stephanie eyed me suspiciously, decided that I meant no impertinence, and contented herself with, \u201cWell, you won\u2019t get very far until you start wearing dresses more often.\u201dMiss Maudie\u2019s hand closed tightly on mine, and I said nothing. Its warmth was enough.Mrs. Grace Merriweather sat on my left, and I felt it would be polite to talk to her. Mr. Merriweather, a faithful Methodist under duress, apparently saw nothing personal in singing, \u201cAmazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me . . .\u201d It was the general opinion of Maycomb, however, that Mrs. Merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him. For certainly Mrs. Merriweather was the most devout lady in Maycomb. I searched for a topic of interest to her. \u201cWhat did you all study this afternoon?\u201d I asked.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cOh child, those poor Mrunas,\u201d she said, and was off. Few other questions would be necessary.Mrs. Merriweather\u2019s large brown eyes always filled with tears when she considered the oppressed. \u201cLiving in that jungle with nobody but J. Grimes Everett,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a white person\u2019ll go near \u2019em but that saintly J. Grimes Everett.\u201dMrs. Merriweather played her voice like an organ; every word she said received its full measure: \u201cThe poverty . . . the darkness . . . the immorality\u2014nobody but J. Grimes Everett knows. You know, when the church gave me that trip to the camp grounds J. Grimes Everett said to me\u2014\u201d\u201cWas he there, ma\u2019am? I thought\u2014\u201d\u201cHome on leave. J. Grimes Everett said to me, he said, \u2018Mrs. Merriweather, you have no conception, no conception of what we are fighting over there.\u2019 That\u2019s what he said to me.\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cI said to him, \u2018Mr. Everett,\u2019 I said, \u2018the ladies of the Maycomb Alabama Methodist Episcopal Church South are behind you one hundred per cent.\u2019 That\u2019s what I said to him. And you know, right then and there I made a pledge in my heart. I said to myself, when I go home I\u2019m going to give a course on the Mrunas and bring J. Grimes Everett\u2019s message to Maycomb and that\u2019s just what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201dWhen Mrs. Merriweather shook her head, her black curls jiggled. \u201cJean Louise,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are a fortunate girl. You live in a Christian home with Christian folks in a Christian town. Out there in J. Grimes Everett\u2019s land there\u2019s nothing but sin and squalor.\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cSin and squalor\u2014what was that, Gertrude?\u201d Mrs. Merriweather turned on her chimes for the lady sitting beside her. \u201cOh that. Well, I always say forgive and forget, forgive and forget. Thing that church ought to do is help her lead a Christian life for those children from here on out. Some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher to encourage her.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, Mrs. Merriweather,\u201d I interrupted, \u201care you all talking about Mayella Ewell?\u201d\u201cMay\u2014? No, child. That darky\u2019s wife. Tom\u2019s wife, Tom\u2014\u201d\u201cRobinson, ma\u2019am.\u201dMrs. Merriweather turned back to her neighbor. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I truly believe, Gertrude,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut some people just don\u2019t see it my way. If we just let them know we forgive \u2019em, that we\u2019ve forgotten it, then this whole thing\u2019ll blow over.\u201d\u201cAh\u2014Mrs. Merriweather,\u201d I interrupted once more, \u201cwhat\u2019ll blow over?\u201dAgain, she turned to me. Mrs. Merriweather was one of those childless adults who find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children. \u201cNothing, Jean Louise,\u201d she said, in stately largo, \u201cthe cooks and field hands are just dissatisfied, but they\u2019re settling down now\u2014they grumbled all next day after that trial.\u201dMrs. Merriweather faced Mrs. Farrow: \u201cGertrude, I tell you there\u2019s nothing more distracting than a sulky darky. Their mouths go down to here. Just ruins your day to have one of \u2019em in the kitchen. You know what I said to my Sophy, Gertrude? I said, \u2018Sophy,\u2019 I said, \u2018you simply are not being a Christian today. Jesus Christ never went around grumbling and complaining,\u2019 and you know, it did her good. She took her eyes off that floor and said, \u2018Nome, Miz Merriweather, Jesus never went around grumbling\u2019.\u2019 I tell you, Gertrude, you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the Lord.\u201dI was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at Finch\u2019s Landing. When I was very small, and if I had been very good during the day, Atticus would let me pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger. The last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it. Mrs. Merriweather had run out of air, I judged, and was replenishing her supply while Mrs. Farrow composed herself to speak.Mrs. Farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet. She had a fresh permanent wave, and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets. She was the second most devout lady in Maycomb. She had a curious habit of prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound.\u201cS-s-s Grace,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s just like I was telling Brother Hutson the other day. \u2018S-s-s Brother Hutson,\u2019 I said, \u2018looks like we\u2019re fighting a losing battle, a losing battle.\u2019 I said, \u2018S-s-s it doesn\u2019t matter to \u2019em one bit. We can educate \u2019em till we\u2019re blue in the face, we can try till we drop to make Christians out of \u2019em, but there\u2019s no lady safe in her bed these nights.\u2019 He said to me, \u2018Mrs. Farrow, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re coming to down here.\u2019 S-s-s I told him that was certainly a fact.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Mrs. Merriweather nodded wisely. Her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups and the soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties. \u201cGertrude,\u201d she said, \u201cI tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town. Good, but misguided. Folks in this town who think they\u2019re doing right, I mean. Now far be it from me to say who, but some of \u2019em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back, but all they did was stir \u2019em up. That\u2019s all they did. Might\u2019ve looked like the right thing to do at the time, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not read in that field, but sulky . . . dissatisfied . . . I tell you if my Sophy\u2019d kept it up another day I\u2019d have let her go. It\u2019s never entered that wool of hers that the only reason I keep her is because this depression\u2019s on and she needs her dollar and a quarter every week she can get it.\u201d\u201cHis food doesn\u2019t stick going down, does it?\u201dMiss Maudie said it. Two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth. She had been sitting silently beside me, her coffee cup balanced on one knee. I had lost the thread of conversation long ago, when they quit talking about Tom Robinson\u2019s wife, and had contented myself with thinking of Finch\u2019s Landing and the river. Aunt Alexandra had got it backwards: the business part of the meeting was blood-curdling, the social hour was dreary.\u201cMaudie, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Mrs. Merriweather.\u201cI\u2019m sure you do,\u201d Miss Maudie said shortly.She said no more. When Miss Maudie was angry her brevity was icy. Something had made her deeply angry, and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice. Mrs. Merriweather reddened, glanced at me, and looked away. I could not see Mrs. Farrow.Aunt Alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments, neatly engaging Mrs. Merriweather and Mrs. Gates in brisk conversation. When she had them well on the road with Mrs. Perkins, Aunt Alexandra stepped back. She gave Miss Maudie a look of pure gratitude, and I wondered at the world of women. Miss Maudie and Aunt Alexandra had never been especially close, and here was Aunty silently thanking her for something. For what, I knew not. I was content to learn that Aunt Alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given. There was no doubt about it, I must soon enter this world, where on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water.But I was more at home in my father\u2019s world. People like Mr. Heck Tate did not trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; even Jem was not highly critical unless you said something stupid. Ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men, seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them. But I liked them. There was something about them, no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed; no matter how undelectable they were, there was something about them that I instinctively liked . . . they weren\u2019t\u2014\u201cHypocrites, Mrs. Perkins, born hypocrites,\u201d Mrs. Merriweather was saying. \u201cAt least we don\u2019t have that sin on our shoulders down here. People up there set \u2019em free, but you don\u2019t see \u2019em settin\u2019 at the table with \u2019em. At least we don\u2019t have the deceit to say to \u2019em yes you\u2019re as good as we are but stay away from us. Down here we just say you live your way and we\u2019ll live ours. I think that woman, that Mrs. Roosevelt\u2019s lost her mind\u2014just plain lost her mind coming down to Birmingham and tryin\u2019 to sit with \u2019em. If I was the Mayor of Birmingham I\u2019d\u2014\u201dWell, neither of us was the Mayor of Birmingham, but I wished I was the Governor of Alabama for one day: I\u2019d let Tom Robinson go so quick the Missionary Society wouldn\u2019t have time to catch its breath. Calpurnia was telling Miss Rachel\u2019s cook the other day how bad Tom was taking things and she didn\u2019t stop talking when I came into the kitchen. She said there wasn\u2019t a thing Atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him, that the last thing he said to Atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was, \u201cGood-bye, Mr. Finch, there ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 you can do now, so there ain\u2019t no use tryin\u2019.\u201d Calpurnia said Atticus told her that the day they took Tom to prison he just gave up hope. She said Atticus tried to explain things to him, and that he must do his best not to lose hope because Atticus was doing his best to get him free. Miss Rachel\u2019s cook asked Calpurnia why didn\u2019t Atticus just say yes, you\u2019ll go free, and leave it at that\u2014seemed like that\u2019d be a big comfort to Tom. Calpurnia said, \u201cBecause you ain\u2019t familiar with the law. First thing you learn when you\u2019re in a lawin\u2019 family is that there ain\u2019t any definite answers to anything. Mr. Finch couldn\u2019t say somethin\u2019s so when he doesn\u2019t know for sure it\u2019s so.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "The front door slammed and I heard Atticus\u2019s footsteps in the hall. Automatically I wondered what time it was. Not nearly time for him to be home, and on Missionary Society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark.He stopped in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and his face was white.\u201cExcuse me, ladies,\u201d he said. \u201cGo right ahead with your meeting, don\u2019t let me disturb you. Alexandra, could you come to the kitchen a minute? I want to borrow Calpurnia for a while.\u201dHe didn\u2019t go through the diningroom, but went down the back hallway and entered the kitchen from the rear door. Aunt Alexandra and I met him. The diningroom door opened again and Miss Maudie joined us. Calpurnia had half risen from her chair.\u201cCal,\u201d Atticus said, \u201cI want you to go with me out to Helen Robinson\u2019s house\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Aunt Alexandra asked, alarmed by the look on my father\u2019s face.\u201cTom\u2019s dead.\u201dAunt Alexandra put her hands to her mouth.\u201cThey shot him,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cHe was running. It was during their exercise period. They said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over. Right in front of them\u2014\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t they try to stop him? Didn\u2019t they give him any warning?\u201d Aunt Alexandra\u2019s voice shook.\u201cOh yes, the guards called to him to stop. They fired a few shots in the air, then to kill. They got him just as he went over the fence. They said if he\u2019d had two good arms he\u2019d have made it, he was moving that fast. Seventeen bullet holes in him. They didn\u2019t have to shoot him that much. Cal, I want you to come out with me and help me tell Helen.\u201d\u201cYes sir,\u201d she murmured, fumbling at her apron. Miss Maudie went to Calpurnia and untied it.\u201cThis is the last straw, Atticus,\u201d Aunt Alexandra said.\u201cDepends on how you look at it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was one Negro, more or less, among two hundred of \u2019em? He wasn\u2019t Tom to them, he was an escaping prisoner.\u201dAtticus leaned against the refrigerator, pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes. \u201cWe had such a good chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI told him what I thought, but I couldn\u2019t in truth say that we had more than a good chance. I guess Tom was tired of white men\u2019s chances and preferred to take his own. Ready, Cal?\u201d\u201cYessir, Mr. Finch.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dAunt Alexandra sat down in Calpurnia\u2019s chair and put her hands to her face. She sat quite still; she was so quiet I wondered if she would faint. I heard Miss Maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps, and in the diningroom the ladies chattered happily.I thought Aunt Alexandra was crying, but when she took her hands away from her face, she was not. She looked weary. She spoke, and her voice was flat.\u201cI can\u2019t say I approve of everything he does, Maudie, but he\u2019s my brother, and I just want to know when this will ever end.\u201d Her voice rose: \u201cIt tears him to pieces. He doesn\u2019t show it much, but it tears him to pieces. I\u2019ve seen him when\u2014what else do they want from him, Maudie, what else?\u201d\u201cWhat does who want, Alexandra?\u201d Miss Maudie asked.\u201cI mean this town. They\u2019re perfectly willing to let him do what they\u2019re too afraid to do themselves\u2014it might lose \u2019em a nickel. They\u2019re perfectly willing to let him wreck his health doing what they\u2019re afraid to do, they\u2019re\u2014\u201d\u201cBe quiet, they\u2019ll hear you,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cHave you ever thought of it this way, Alexandra? Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we\u2019re paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Aunt Alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelve-year-old nephew.\u201cThe handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked White Only; the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody, not just us; the handful of people with enough humility to think, when they look at a Negro, there but for the Lord\u2019s kindness am I.\u201d Miss Maudie\u2019s old crispness was returning: \u201cThe handful of people in this town with background, that\u2019s who they are.\u201dHad I been attentive, I would have had another scrap to add to Jem\u2019s definition of background, but I found myself shaking and couldn\u2019t stop. I had seen Enfield Prison Farm, and Atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me. It was the size of a football field.\u201cStop that shaking,\u201d commanded Miss Maudie, and I stopped. \u201cGet up, Alexandra, we\u2019ve left \u2019em long enough.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Aunt Alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips. She took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose. She patted her hair and said, \u201cDo I show it?\u201d\u201cNot a sign,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cAre you together again, Jean Louise?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s join the ladies,\u201d she said grimly.Their voices swelled when Miss Maudie opened the door to the diningroom. Aunt Alexandra was ahead of me, and I saw her head go up as she went through the door.\u201cOh, Mrs. Perkins,\u201d she said, \u201cyou need some more coffee. Let me get it.\u201d\u201cCalpurnia\u2019s on an errand for a few minutes, Grace,\u201d said Miss Maudie. \u201cLet me pass you some more of these dewberry tarts. \u2019dyou hear what that cousin of mine did the other day, the one who likes to go fishing? . . .\u201dAnd so they went, down the row of laughing women, around the diningroom, refilling coffee cups, dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the temporary domestic disaster of losing Calpurnia.The gentle hum began again: \u201cYes sir, Mrs. Perkins, that J. Grimes Everett is a martyred saint, he . . . needed to get married so they ran . . . to the beauty parlor every Saturday afternoon . . . soon as the sun goes down. He goes to bed with the . . . chickens, a crate full of sick chickens, Fred says that\u2019s what started it all. Fred says . . .\u201dAunt Alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. She looked at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them. I carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to Mrs. Merriweather. With my very best company manners, I asked her if she would have some. After all, if Aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could I.25\u201cDon\u2019t do that, Scout. Set him out on the back steps.\u201d\u201cJem, are you crazy? . . .\u201d\u201cI said set him out on the back steps.\u201dSighing, I scooped up the small creature, placed him on the bottom step and went back to my cot. September had come, but not a trace of cool weather with it, and we were still sleeping on the back screen porch. Lightning bugs were still about, the night crawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long had not gone wherever they go when autumn comes.A roly-poly had found his way inside the house; I reasoned that the tiny varmint had crawled up the steps and under the door. I was putting my book on the floor beside my cot when I saw him. The creatures are no more than an inch long, and when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball.I lay on my stomach, reached down and poked him. He rolled up. Then, feeling safe, I suppose, he slowly unrolled. He traveled a few inches on his hundred legs and I touched him again. He rolled up. Feeling sleepy, I decided to end things. My hand was going down on him when Jem spoke.Jem was scowling. It was probably a part of the stage he was going through, and I wished he would hurry up and get through it. He was certainly never cruel to animals, but I had never known his charity to embrace the insect world.\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I mash him?\u201d I asked.\u201cBecause they don\u2019t bother you,\u201d Jem answered in the darkness. He had turned out his reading light.\u201cReckon you\u2019re at the stage now where you don\u2019t kill flies and mosquitoes now, I reckon,\u201d I said. \u201cLemme know when you change your mind. Tell you one thing, though, I ain\u2019t gonna sit around and not scratch a redbug.\u201d\u201cAw dry up,\u201d he answered drowsily.Jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day, not I. Comfortable, I lay on my back and waited for sleep, and while waiting I thought of Dill. He had left us the first of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was out\u2014he guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summers in Maycomb. Miss Rachel took us with them in the taxi to Maycomb Junction, and Dill waved to us from the train window until he was out of sight. He was not out of mind: I missed him. The last two days of his time with us, Jem had taught him to swim\u2014Taught him to swim. I was wide awake, remembering what Dill had told me.Barker\u2019s Eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the Meridian highway about a mile from town. It is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist, and the short walk to the creek is easy, but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk, when the traffic is light, is tiresome, and swimmers are careful not to stay too late.According to Dill, he and Jem had just come to the highway when they saw Atticus driving toward them. He looked like he had not seen them, so they both waved. Atticus finally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said, \u201cYou\u2019d better catch a ride back. I won\u2019t be going home for a while.\u201d Calpurnia was in the back seat.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Jem protested, then pleaded, and Atticus said, \u201cAll right, you can come with us if you stay in the car.\u201dOn the way to Tom Robinson\u2019s, Atticus told them what had happened.They turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the Ewell residence, down the narrow lane to the Negro cabins. Dill said a crowd of black children were playing marbles in Tom\u2019s front yard. Atticus parked the car and got out. Calpurnia followed him through the front gate.Dill heard him ask one of the children, \u201cWhere\u2019s your mother, Sam?\u201d and heard Sam say, \u201cShe down at Sis Stevens\u2019s, Mr. Finch. Want me run fetch her?\u201dDill said Atticus looked uncertain, then he said yes, and Sam scampered off. \u201cGo on with your game, boys,\u201d Atticus said to the children.A little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at Atticus. Dill said her hair was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in a bright bow. She grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our father, but she was too small to navigate the steps. Dill said Atticus went to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. She grabbed it and he eased her down the steps. Then he gave her to Calpurnia.Sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up. Dill said Helen said, \u201c\u2019evenin\u2019, Mr. Finch, won\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d But she didn\u2019t say any more. Neither did Atticus.\u201cScout,\u201d said Dill, \u201cshe just fell down in the dirt. Just fell down in the dirt, like a giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her. Just ump\u2014\u201d Dill\u2019s fat foot hit the ground. \u201cLike you\u2019d step on an ant.\u201dDill said Calpurnia and Atticus lifted Helen to her feet and half carried, half walked her to the cabin. They stayed inside a long time, and Atticus came out alone. When they drove back by the dump, some of the Ewells hollered at them, but Dill didn\u2019t catch what they said.Maycomb was interested by the news of Tom\u2019s death for perhaps two days; two days was enough for the information to spread through the county. \u201cDid you hear about? . . . No? Well, they say he was runnin\u2019 fit to beat lightnin\u2019 . . .\u201d To Maycomb, Tom\u2019s death was Typical. Typical of a nigger to cut and run. Typical of a nigger\u2019s mentality to have no plan, no thought for the future, just run blind first chance he saw. Funny thing, Atticus Finch might\u2019ve got him off scot free, but wait\u2014? Hell no. You know how they are. Easy come, easy go. Just shows you, that Robinson boy was legally married, they say he kept himself clean, went to church and all that, but when it comes down to the line the veneer\u2019s mighty thin. Nigger always comes out in \u2019em.A few more details, enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, then nothing to talk about until The Maycomb Tribune appeared the following Thursday. There was a brief obituary in the Colored News, but there was also an editorial.Mr. B. B. Underwood was at his most bitter, and he couldn\u2019t have cared less who canceled advertising and subscriptions. (But Maycomb didn\u2019t play that way: Mr. Underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to, he\u2019d still get his advertising and subscriptions. If he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper that was his business.) Mr. Underwood didn\u2019t talk about miscarriages of justice, he was writing so children could understand. Mr. Underwood simply figured it was a sin to kill cripples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping. He likened Tom\u2019s death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children, and Maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in The Montgomery Advertiser.How could this be so, I wondered, as I read Mr. Underwood\u2019s editorial. Senseless killing\u2014Tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had fought for him all the way. Then Mr. Underwood\u2019s meaning became clear: Atticus had used every tool available to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in the secret courts of men\u2019s hearts Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed.The name Ewell gave me a queasy feeling. Maycomb had lost no time in getting Mr. Ewell\u2019s views on Tom\u2019s demise and passing them along through that English Channel of gossip, Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Stephanie told Aunt Alexandra in Jem\u2019s presence (\u201cOh foot, he\u2019s old enough to listen\u201d) that Mr. Ewell said it made one down and about two more to go. Jem told me not to be afraid, Mr. Ewell was more hot gas than anything. Jem also told me that if I breathed a word to Atticus, if in any way I let Atticus know I knew, Jem would personally never speak to me again.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "26School started, and so did our daily trips past the Radley Place. Jem was in the seventh grade and went to high school, beyond the grammar-school building; I was now in the third grade, and our routines were so different I only walked to school with Jem in the mornings and saw him at mealtimes. He went out for football, but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team water buckets. This he did with enthusiasm; most afternoons he was seldom home before dark.The Radley Place had ceased to terrify me, but it was no less gloomy, no less chilly under its great oaks, and no less uninviting. Mr. Nathan Radley could still be seen on a clear day, walking to and from town; we knew Boo was there, for the same old reason\u2014nobody\u2019d seen him carried out yet. I sometimes felt a twinge of remorse, when passing by the old place, at ever having taken part in what must have been sheer torment to Arthur Radley\u2014what reasonable recluse wants children peeping through his shutters, delivering greetings on the end of a fishing-pole, wandering in his collards at night?And yet I remembered. Two Indian-head pennies, chewing gum, soap dolls, a rusty medal, a broken watch and chain. Jem must have put them away somewhere. I stopped and looked at the tree one afternoon: the trunk was swelling around its cement patch. The patch itself was turning yellow.We had almost seen him a couple of times, a good enough score for anybody.But I still looked for him each time I went by. Maybe someday we would see him. I imagined how it would be: when it happened, he\u2019d just be sitting in the swing when I came along. \u201cHidy do, Mr. Arthur,\u201d I would say, as if I had said it every afternoon of my life. \u201cEvening, Jean Louise,\u201d he would say, as if he had said it every afternoon of my life, \u201cright pretty spell we\u2019re having, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes sir, right pretty,\u201d I would say, and go on.It was only a fantasy. We would never see him. He probably did go out when the moon was down and gaze upon Miss Stephanie Crawford. I\u2019d have picked somebody else to look at, but that was his business. He would never gaze at us.\u201cYou aren\u2019t starting that again, are you?\u201d said Atticus one night, when I expressed a stray desire just to have one good look at Boo Radley before I died. \u201cIf you are, I\u2019ll tell you right now: stop it. I\u2019m too old to go chasing you off the Radley property. Besides, it\u2019s dangerous. You might get shot. You know Mr. Nathan shoots at every shadow he sees, even shadows that leave size-four bare footprints. You were lucky not to be killed.\u201dI hushed then and there. At the same time I marveled at Atticus. This was the first he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew. And it had happened years ago. No, only last summer\u2014no, summer before last, when . . . time was playing tricks on me. I must remember to ask Jem.So many things had happened to us, Boo Radley was the least of our fears. Atticus said he didn\u2019t see how anything else could happen, that things had a way of settling down, and after enough time passed people would forget that Tom Robinson\u2019s existence was ever brought to their attention.Perhaps Atticus was right, but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke in a closed room. The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jem and me; it seemed that they discussed it with their children, and their attitude must have been that neither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, so their children must be nice to us in spite of him. The children would never have thought that up for themselves: had our classmates been left to their own devices, Jem and I would have had several swift, satisfying fistfights apiece and ended the matter for good. As it was, we were compelled to hold our heads high and be, respectively, a gentleman and a lady. In a way, it was like the era of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one odd thing, though, that I never understood: in spite of Atticus\u2019s shortcomings as a parent, people were content to re-elect him to the state legislature that year, as usual, without opposition. I came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar, I withdrew from them, and never thought about them until I was forced to.I was forced to one day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events period. Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents, and reveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils: standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise; delivering a short talk made him word-conscious; learning his current event strengthened his memory; being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the Group.The idea was profound, but as usual, in Maycomb it didn\u2019t work very well. In the first place, few rural children had access to newspapers, so the burden of Current Events was borne by the town children, convincing the bus children more deeply that the town children got all the attention anyway. The rural children who could, usually brought clippings from what they called The Grit Paper, a publication spurious in the eyes of Miss Gates, our teacher. Why she frowned when a child recited from The Grit Paper I never knew, but in some way it was associated with liking fiddling, eating syrupy biscuits for lunch, being a holy-roller, singing Sweetly Sings the Donkey and pronouncing it dunkey, all of which the state paid teachers to discourage.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Even so, not many of the children knew what a Current Event was. Little Chuck Little, a hundred years old in his knowledge of cows and their habits, was halfway through an Uncle Natchell story when Miss Gates stopped him: \u201cCharles, that is not a current event. That is an advertisement.\u201dCecil Jacobs knew what one was, though. When his turn came, he went to the front of the room and began, \u201cOld Hitler\u2014\u201d\u201cAdolf Hitler, Cecil,\u201d said Miss Gates. \u201cOne never begins with Old anybody.\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cOld Adolf Hitler has been prosecutin\u2019 the\u2014\u201d\u201cPersecuting, Cecil . . .\u201d\u201cNome, Miss Gates, it says here\u2014well anyway, old Adolf Hitler has been after the Jews and he\u2019s puttin\u2019 \u2019em in prisons and he\u2019s taking away all their property and he won\u2019t let any of \u2019em out of the country and he\u2019s washin\u2019 all the feeble-minded and\u2014\u201d\u201cWashing the feeble-minded?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am, Miss Gates, I reckon they don\u2019t have sense enough to wash themselves, I don\u2019t reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean. Well anyway, Hitler\u2019s started a program to round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to register \u2019em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and I think this is a bad thing and that\u2019s my current event.\u201d\u201cVery good, Cecil,\u201d said Miss Gates. Puffing, Cecil returned to his seat.A hand went up in the back of the room. \u201cHow can he do that?\u201d\u201cWho do what?\u201d asked Miss Gates patiently.\u201cI mean how can Hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that, looks like the govamint\u2019d stop him,\u201d said the owner of the hand.\u201cHitler is the government,\u201d said Miss Gates, and seizing an opportunity to make education dynamic, she went to the blackboard. She printed DEMOCRACY in large letters. \u201cDemocracy,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes anybody have a definition?\u201d\u201cUs,\u201d somebody said.I raised my hand, remembering an old campaign slogan Atticus had once told me about.\u201cWhat do you think it means, Jean Louise?\u201d\u201c \u2018Equal rights for all, special privileges for none,\u2019 \u201c I quoted.\u201cVery good, Jean Louise, very good,\u201d Miss Gates smiled. In front of DEMOCRACY, she printed WE ARE A. \u201cNow class, say it all together, \u2018We are a democracy.\u2019 \u201dWe said it. Then Miss Gates said, \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between America and Germany. We are a democracy and Germany is a dictatorship. Dictator-ship,\u201d she said. \u201cOver here we don\u2019t believe in persecuting anybody. Persecution comes from people who are prejudiced. Pre-ju-dice,\u201d she enunciated carefully. \u201cThere are no better people in the world than the Jews, and why Hitler doesn\u2019t think so is a mystery to me.\u201dAn inquiring soul in the middle of the room said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they like the Jews, you reckon, Miss Gates?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, Henry. They contribute to every society they live in, and most of all, they are a deeply religious people. Hitler\u2019s trying to do away with religion, so maybe he doesn\u2019t like them for that reason.\u201dCecil spoke up. \u201cWell I don\u2019t know for certain,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re supposed to change money or somethin\u2019, but that ain\u2019t no cause to persecute \u2019em. They\u2019re white, ain\u2019t they?\u201dMiss Gates said, \u201cWhen you get to high school, Cecil, you\u2019ll learn that the Jews have been persecuted since the beginning of history, even driven out of their own country. It\u2019s one of the most terrible stories in history. Time for arithmetic, children.\u201dAs I had never liked arithmetic, I spent the period looking out the window. The only time I ever saw Atticus scowl was when Elmer Davis would give us the latest on Hitler. Atticus would snap off the radio and say, \u201cHmp!\u201d I asked him once why he was impatient with Hitler and Atticus said, \u201cBecause he\u2019s a maniac.\u201dThis would not do, I mused, as the class proceeded with its sums. One maniac and millions of German folks. Looked to me like they\u2019d shut Hitler in a pen instead of letting him shut them up. There was something else wrong\u2014I would ask my father about it.I did, and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didn\u2019t know the answer.\u201cBut it\u2019s okay to hate Hitler?\u201d\u201cIt is not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay to hate anybody.\u201d\u201cAtticus,\u201d I said, \u201cthere\u2019s somethin\u2019 I don\u2019t understand. Miss Gates said it was awful, Hitler doin\u2019 like he does, she got real red in the face about it\u2014\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cI should think she would.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNothing, sir.\u201d I went away, not sure that I could explain to Atticus what was on my mind, not sure that I could clarify what was only a feeling. Perhaps Jem could provide the answer. Jem understood school things better than Atticus.Jem was worn out from a day\u2019s water-carrying. There were at least twelve banana peels on the floor by his bed, surrounding an empty milk bottle. \u201cWhatcha stuffin\u2019 for?\u201d I asked.\u201cCoach says if I can gain twenty-five pounds by year after next I can play,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the quickest way.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t throw it all up. Jem,\u201d I said, \u201cI wanta ask you somethin\u2019.\u201d\u201cShoot.\u201d He put down his book and stretched his legs.\u201cMiss Gates is a nice lady, ain\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cWhy sure,\u201d said Jem. \u201cI liked her when I was in her room.\u201d\u201cShe hates Hitler a lot . . .\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u201cWell, she went on today about how bad it was him treatin\u2019 the Jews like that. Jem, it\u2019s not right to persecute anybody, is it? I mean have mean thoughts about anybody, even, is it?\u201d\u201cGracious no, Scout. What\u2019s eatin\u2019 you?\u201d\u201cWell, coming out of the courthouse that night Miss Gates was\u2014she was goin\u2019 down the steps in front of us, you musta not seen her\u2014she was talking with Miss Stephanie Crawford. I heard her say it\u2019s time somebody taught \u2019em a lesson, they were gettin\u2019 way above themselves, an\u2019 the next thing they think they can do is marry us. Jem, how can you hate Hitler so bad an\u2019 then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home\u2014\u201dJem was suddenly furious. He leaped off the bed, grabbed me by the collar and shook me. \u201cI never wanta hear about that courthouse again, ever, ever, you hear me? You hear me? Don\u2019t you ever say one word to me about it again, you hear? Now go on!\u201dI was too surprised to cry. I crept from Jem\u2019s room and shut the door softly, lest undue noise set him off again. Suddenly tired, I wanted Atticus. He was in the livingroom, and I went to him and tried to get in his lap.Atticus smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re getting so big now, I\u2019ll just have to hold a part of you.\u201d He held me close. \u201cScout,\u201d he said softly, \u201cdon\u2019t let Jem get you down. He\u2019s having a rough time these days. I heard you back there.\u201dAtticus said that Jem was trying hard to forget something, but what he was really doing was storing it away for a while, until enough time passed. Then he would be able to think about it and sort things out. When he was able to think about it, Jem would be himself again.27Things did settle down, after a fashion, as Atticus said they would. By the middle of October, only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two Maycomb citizens. No, there were three things, and they did not directly concern us\u2014the Finches\u2014but in a way they did.The first thing was that Mr. Bob Ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen-thirties: he was the only man I ever heard of who was fired from the WPA for laziness. I suppose his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted only as long as his notoriety: Mr. Ewell found himself as forgotten as Tom Robinson. Thereafter, he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare office for his check, and received it with no grace amid obscure mutterings that the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldn\u2019t permit an honest man to make a living. Ruth Jones, the welfare lady, said Mr. Ewell openly accused Atticus of getting his job. She was upset enough to walk down to Atticus\u2019s office and tell him about it. Atticus told Miss Ruth not to fret, that if Bob Ewell wanted to discuss Atticus\u2019s \u201cgetting\u201d his job, he knew the way to the office.The second thing happened to Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor was not a Sunday-night churchgoer; Mrs. Taylor was. Judge Taylor savored his Sunday night hour alone in his big house, and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the writings of Bob Taylor (no kin, but the judge would have been proud to claim it). One Sunday night, lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction, Judge Taylor\u2019s attention was wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise. \u201cHush,\u201d he said to Ann Taylor, his fat nondescript dog. Then he realized he was speaking to an empty room; the scratching noise was coming from the rear of the house. Judge Taylor clumped to the back porch to let Ann out and found the screen door swinging open. A shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye, and that was all he saw of his visitor. Mrs. Taylor came home from church to find her husband in his chair, lost in the writings of Bob Taylor, with a shotgun across his lap.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "The third thing happened to Helen Robinson, Tom\u2019s widow. If Mr. Ewell was as forgotten as Tom Robinson, Tom Robinson was as forgotten as Boo Radley. But Tom was not forgotten by his employer, Mr. Link Deas. Mr. Link Deas made a job for Helen. He didn\u2019t really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the way things turned out. I never knew who took care of her children while Helen was away. Calpurnia said it was hard on Helen, because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to avoid the Ewells, who, according to Helen, \u201cchunked at her\u201d the first time she tried to use the public road. Mr. Link Deas eventually received the impression that Helen was coming to work each morning from the wrong direction, and dragged the reason out of her. \u201cJust let it be, Mr. Link, please suh,\u201d Helen begged. \u201cThe hell I will,\u201d said Mr. Link. He told her to come by his store that afternoon before she left. She did, and Mr. Link closed his store, put his hat firmly on his head, and walked Helen home. He walked her the short way, by the Ewells\u2019. On his way back, Mr. Link stopped at the crazy gate.\u201cEwell?\u201d he called. \u201cI say Ewell!\u201dThe windows, normally packed with children, were empty.\u201cI know every last one of you\u2019s in there a-layin\u2019 on the floor! Now hear me, Bob Ewell: if I hear one more peep outa my girl Helen about not bein\u2019 able to walk this road I\u2019ll have you in jail before sundown!\u201d Mr. Link spat in the dust and walked home.Helen went to work next morning and used the public road. Nobody chunked at her, but when she was a few yards beyond the Ewell house, she looked around and saw Mr. Ewell walking behind her. She turned and walked on, and Mr. Ewell kept the same distance behind her until she reached Mr. Link Deas\u2019s house. All the way to the house, Helen said, she heard a soft voice behind her, crooning foul words. Thoroughly frightened, she telephoned Mr. Link at his store, which was not too far from his house. As Mr. Link came out of his store he saw Mr. Ewell leaning on the fence. Mr. Ewell said, \u201cDon\u2019t you look at me, Link Deas, like I was dirt. I ain\u2019t jumped your\u2014\u201d\u201cFirst thing you can do, Ewell, is get your stinkin\u2019 carcass off my property. You\u2019re leanin\u2019 on it an\u2019 I can\u2019t afford fresh paint for it. Second thing you can do is stay away from my cook or I\u2019ll have you up for assault\u2014\u201d\u201cI ain\u2019t touched her, Link Deas, and ain\u2019t about to go with no nigger!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid, an\u2019 if assault ain\u2019t enough to keep you locked up a while, I\u2019ll get you in on the Ladies\u2019 Law, so get outa my sight! If you don\u2019t think I mean it, just bother that girl again!\u201dMr. Ewell evidently thought he meant it, for Helen reported no further trouble.\u201cI don\u2019t like it, Atticus, I don\u2019t like it at all,\u201d was Aunt Alexandra\u2019s assessment of these events. \u201cThat man seems to have a permanent running grudge against everybody connected with that case. I know how that kind are about paying off grudges, but I don\u2019t understand why he should harbor one\u2014he had his way in court, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cI think I understand,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cIt might be because he knows in his heart that very few people in Maycomb really believed his and Mayella\u2019s yarns. He thought he\u2019d be a hero, but all he got for his pain was . . . was, okay, we\u2019ll convict this Negro but get back to your dump. He\u2019s had his fling with about everybody now, so he ought to be satisfied. He\u2019ll settle down when the weather changes.\u201d\u201cBut why should he try to burgle John Taylor\u2019s house? He obviously didn\u2019t know John was home or he wouldn\u2019t have tried. Only lights John shows on Sunday nights are on the front porch and back in his den . . .\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know if Bob Ewell cut that screen, you don\u2019t know who did it,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cBut I can guess. I proved him a liar but John made him look like a fool. All the time Ewell was on the stand I couldn\u2019t dare look at John and keep a straight face. John looked at him as if he were a three-legged chicken or a square egg. Don\u2019t tell me judges don\u2019t try to prejudice juries,\u201d Atticus chuckled.By the end of October, our lives had become the familiar routine of school, play, study. Jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to forget, and our classmates mercifully let us forget our father\u2019s eccentricities. Cecil Jacobs asked me one time if Atticus was a Radical. When I asked Atticus, Atticus was so amused I was rather annoyed, but he said he wasn\u2019t laughing at me. He said, \u201cYou tell Cecil I\u2019m about as radical as Cotton Tom Heflin.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Aunt Alexandra was thriving. Miss Maudie must have silenced the whole missionary society at one blow, for Aunty again ruled that roost. Her refreshments grew even more delicious. I learned more about the poor Mrunas\u2019 social life from listening to Mrs. Merriweather: they had so little sense of family that the whole tribe was one big family. A child had as many fathers as there were men in the community, as many mothers as there were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing his utmost to change this state of affairs, and desperately needed our prayers.Maycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the year before that, with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had removed from their store windows and automobiles the stickers that said NRA\u2014WE DO OUR PART. I asked Atticus why, and he said it was because the National Recovery Act was dead. I asked who killed it; he said nine old men.The second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national significance. Until then, Halloween in Maycomb was a completely unorganized affair. Each child did what he wanted to do, with assistance from other children if there was anything to be moved, such as placing a light buggy on top of the livery stable. But parents thought things went too far last year, when the peace of Miss Tutti and Miss Frutti was shattered.Misses Tutti and Frutti Barber were maiden ladies, sisters, who lived together in the only Maycomb residence boasting a cellar. The Barber ladies were rumored to be Republicans, having migrated from Clanton, Alabama, in 1911. Their ways were strange to us, and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew, but they wanted one, and they dug one, and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it.Misses Tutti and Frutti (their names were Sarah and Frances), aside from their Yankee ways, were both deaf. Miss Tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence, but Miss Frutti, not about to miss anything, employed an ear trumpet so enormous that Jem declared it was a loud-speaker from one of those dog Victrolas.With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children had waited until the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped into their livingroom (nobody but the Radleys locked up at night), stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein, and hid it in the cellar. I deny having taken part in such a thing.\u201cI heard \u2019em!\u201d was the cry that awoke the Misses Barber\u2019s neighbors at dawn next morning. \u201cHeard \u2019em drive a truck up to the door! Stomped around like horses. They\u2019re in New Orleans by now!\u201dMiss Tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days ago had purloined their furniture. \u201cDa-rk they were,\u201d she said. \u201cSyrians.\u201dMr. Heck Tate was summoned. He surveyed the area and said he thought it was a local job. Miss Frutti said she\u2019d know a Maycomb voice anywhere, and there were no Maycomb voices in that parlor last night\u2014rolling their r\u2019s all over her premises, they were. Nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate their furniture, Miss Tutti insisted, so Mr. Tate was obliged to go ten miles out the road, round up the county hounds, and put them on the trail.Mr. Tate started them off at the Misses Barber\u2019s front steps, but all they did was run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door. When Mr. Tate set them in motion three times, he finally guessed the truth. By noontime that day, there was not a barefooted child to be seen in Maycomb, and nobody took off his shoes until the hounds were returned.So the Maycomb ladies said things would be different this year. The high-school auditorium would be open, there would be a pageant for the grown-ups; apple-bobbing, taffy-pulling, pinning the tail on the donkey for the children. There would also be a prize of twenty-five cents for the best Halloween costume, created by the wearer.Jem and I both groaned. Not that we\u2019d ever done anything, it was the principle of the thing. Jem considered himself too old for Halloween anyway; he said he wouldn\u2019t be caught anywhere near the high school at something like that. Oh well, I thought, Atticus would take me.I soon learned, however, that my services would be required on stage that evening. Mrs. Grace Merriweather had composed an original pageant entitled Maycomb County: Ad Astra Per Aspera, and I was to be a ham. She thought it would be adorable if some of the children were costumed to represent the county\u2019s agricultural products: Cecil Jacobs would be dressed up to look like a cow; Agnes Boone would make a lovely butterbean, another child would be a peanut, and on down the line until Mrs. Merriweather\u2019s imagination and the supply of children were exhausted.Our only duties, as far as I could gather from our two rehearsals, were to enter from stage left as Mrs. Merriweather (not only the author, but the narrator) identified us. When she called out, \u201cPork,\u201d that was my cue. Then the assembled company would sing, \u201cMaycomb County, Maycomb County, we will aye be true to thee,\u201d as the grand finale, and Mrs. Merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "My costume was not much of a problem. Mrs. Crenshaw, the local seamstress, had as much imagination as Mrs. Merriweather. Mrs. Crenshaw took some chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham. This she covered with brown cloth, and painted it to resemble the original. I could duck under and someone would pull the contraption down over my head. It came almost to my knees. Mrs. Crenshaw thoughtfully left two peepholes for me. She did a fine job; Jem said I looked exactly like a ham with legs. There were several discomforts, though: it was hot, it was a close fit; if my nose itched I couldn\u2019t scratch, and once inside I could not get out of it alone.When Halloween came, I assumed that the whole family would be present to watch me perform, but I was disappointed. Atticus said as tactfully as he could that he just didn\u2019t think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. He had been in Montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon. He thought Jem might escort me if I asked him.Aunt Alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, she\u2019d been decorating the stage all afternoon and was worn out\u2014she stopped short in the middle of her sentence. She closed her mouth, then opened it to say something, but no words came.\u201c\u2019s matter, Aunty?\u201d I asked.\u201cOh nothing, nothing,\u201d she said, \u201csomebody just walked over my grave.\u201d She put away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and suggested that I give the family a preview in the livingroom. So Jem squeezed me into my costume, stood at the livingroom door, called out \u201cPo-ork,\u201d exactly as Mrs. Merriweather would have done, and I marched in. Atticus and Aunt Alexandra were delighted.I repeated my part for Calpurnia in the kitchen and she said I was wonderful. I wanted to go across the street to show Miss Maudie, but Jem said she\u2019d probably be at the pageant anyway.After that, it didn\u2019t matter whether they went or not. Jem said he would take me. Thus began our longest journey together.28The weather was unusually warm for the last day of October. We didn\u2019t even need jackets. The wind was growing stronger, and Jem said it might be raining before we got home. There was no moon.The street light on the corner cast sharp shadows on the Radley house. I heard Jem laugh softly. \u201cBet nobody bothers them tonight,\u201d he said. Jem was carrying my ham costume, rather awkwardly, as it was hard to hold. I thought it gallant of him to do so.\u201cIt is a scary place though, ain\u2019t it?\u201d I said. \u201cBoo doesn\u2019t mean anybody any harm, but I\u2019m right glad you\u2019re along.\u201d\u201cYou know Atticus wouldn\u2019t let you go to the schoolhouse by yourself,\u201d Jem said.\u201cDon\u2019t see why, it\u2019s just around the corner and across the yard.\u201d\u201cThat yard\u2019s a mighty long place for little girls to cross at night,\u201d Jem teased. \u201cAin\u2019t you scared of haints?\u201dWe laughed. Haints, Hot Steams, incantations, secret signs, had vanished with our years as mist with sunrise. \u201cWhat was that old thing,\u201d Jem said, \u201cAngel bright, life-in-death; get off the road, don\u2019t suck my breath.\u201d\u201cCut it out, now,\u201d I said. We were in front of the Radley Place.Jem said, \u201cBoo must not be at home. Listen.\u201dHigh above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in, plunging from the shrill kee, kee of the sunflower bird to the irascible qua-ack of a bluejay, to the sad lament of Poor Will, Poor Will, Poor Will.We turned the corner and I tripped on a root growing in the road. Jem tried to help me, but all he did was drop my costume in the dust. I didn\u2019t fall, though, and soon we were on our way again.We turned off the road and entered the schoolyard. It was pitch black.\u201cHow do you know where we\u2019re at, Jem?\u201d I asked, when we had gone a few steps.\u201cI can tell we\u2019re under the big oak because we\u2019re passin\u2019 through a cool spot. Careful now, and don\u2019t fall again.\u201dWe had slowed to a cautious gait, and were feeling our way forward so as not to bump into the tree. The tree was a single and ancient oak; two children could not reach around its trunk and touch hands. It was far away from teachers, their spies, and curious neighbors: it was near the Radley lot, but the Radleys were not curious. A small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games.The lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance, but they blinded us, if anything. \u201cDon\u2019t look ahead, Scout,\u201d Jem said. \u201cLook at the ground and you won\u2019t fall.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cYou should have brought the flashlight, Jem.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t know it was this dark. Didn\u2019t look like it\u2019d be this dark earlier in the evening. So cloudy, that\u2019s why. It\u2019ll hold off a while, though.\u201dSomeone leaped at us.\u201cGod amighty!\u201d Jem yelled.A circle of light burst in our faces, and Cecil Jacobs jumped in glee behind it. \u201cHa-a-a, gotcha!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cThought you\u2019d be comin\u2019 along this way!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 way out here by yourself, boy? Ain\u2019t you scared of Boo Radley?\u201dCecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents, hadn\u2019t seen us, then had ventured down this far because he knew good and well we\u2019d be coming along. He thought Mr. Finch\u2019d be with us, though.\u201cShucks, ain\u2019t much but around the corner,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWho\u2019s scared to go around the corner?\u201d We had to admit that Cecil was pretty good, though. He had given us a fright, and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse, that was his privilege.\u201cSay,\u201d I said, \u201cain\u2019t you a cow tonight? Where\u2019s your costume?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up behind the stage,\u201d he said. \u201cMrs. Merriweather says the pageant ain\u2019t comin\u2019 on for a while. You can put yours back of the stage by mine, Scout, and we can go with the rest of \u2019em.\u201dThis was an excellent idea, Jem thought. He also thought it a good thing that Cecil and I would be together. This way, Jem would be left to go with people his own age.When we reached the auditorium, the whole town was there except Atticus and the ladies worn out from decorating, and the usual outcasts and shut-ins. Most of the county, it seemed, was there: the hall was teeming with slicked-up country people. The high school building had a wide downstairs hallway; people milled around booths that had been installed along each side.\u201cOh Jem, I forgot my money,\u201d I sighed, when I saw them.\u201cAtticus didn\u2019t,\u201d Jem said. \u201cHere\u2019s thirty cents, you can do six things. See you later on.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, quite content with thirty cents and Cecil. I went with Cecil down to the front of the auditorium, through a door on one side, and backstage. I got rid of my ham costume and departed in a hurry, for Mrs. Merriweather was standing at a lectern in front of the first row of seats making last-minute, frenzied changes in the script.\u201cHow much money you got?\u201d I asked Cecil. Cecil had thirty cents, too, which made us even. We squandered our first nickels on the House of Horrors, which scared us not at all; we entered the black seventh-grade room and were led around by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects alleged to be the component parts of a human being. \u201cHere\u2019s his eyes,\u201d we were told when we touched two peeled grapes on a saucer. \u201cHere\u2019s his heart,\u201d which felt like raw liver. \u201cThese are his innards,\u201d and our hands were thrust into a plate of cold spaghetti.Cecil and I visited several booths. We each bought a sack of Mrs. Judge Taylor\u2019s homemade divinity. I wanted to bob for apples, but Cecil said it wasn\u2019t sanitary. His mother said he might catch something from everybody\u2019s heads having been in the same tub. \u201cAin\u2019t anything around town now to catch,\u201d I protested. But Cecil said his mother said it was unsanitary to eat after folks. I later asked Aunt Alexandra about this, and she said people who held such views were usually climbers.We were about to purchase a blob of taffy when Mrs. Merriweather\u2019s runners appeared and told us to go backstage, it was time to get ready. The auditorium was filling with people; the Maycomb County High School band had assembled in front below the stage; the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain rippled and billowed from the scurrying going on behind it.Backstage, Cecil and I found the narrow hallway teeming with people: adults in homemade three-corner hats, Confederate caps, Spanish-American War hats, and World War helmets. Children dressed as various agricultural enterprises crowded around the one small window.\u201cSomebody\u2019s mashed my costume,\u201d I wailed in dismay. Mrs. Merriweather galloped to me, reshaped the chicken wire, and thrust me inside.\u201cYou all right in there, Scout?\u201d asked Cecil. \u201cYou sound so far off, like you was on the other side of a hill.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t sound any nearer,\u201d I said.The band played the national anthem, and we heard the audience rise. Then the bass drum sounded. Mrs. Merriweather, stationed behind her lectern beside the band, said: \u201cMaycomb County: Ad Astra Per Aspera.\u201d The bass drum boomed again. \u201cThat means,\u201d said Mrs. Merriweather, translating for the rustic elements, \u201cfrom the mud to the stars.\u201d She added, unnecessarily it seemed to me, \u201cA pageant.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cReckon they wouldn\u2019t know what it was if she didn\u2019t tell \u2019em,\u201d whispered Cecil, who was immediately shushed.\u201cThe whole town knows it,\u201d I breathed.\u201cBut the country folks\u2019ve come in,\u201d Cecil said.\u201cBe quiet back there,\u201d a man\u2019s voice ordered, and we were silent.The bass drum went boom with every sentence Mrs. Merriweather uttered. She chanted mournfully about Maycomb County being older than the state, that it was part of the Mississippi and Alabama Territories, that the first white man to set foot in the virgin forests was the Probate Judge\u2019s great-grandfather five times removed, who was never heard of again. Then came the fearless Colonel Maycomb, for whom the county was named.Andrew Jackson appointed him to a position of authority and Colonel Maycomb\u2019s misplaced self-confidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. Colonel Maycomb persevered in his efforts to make the region safe for democracy, but his first campaign was his last. His orders, relayed to him by a friendly Indian runner, were to move south. After consulting a tree to ascertain from its lichen which way was south, and taking no lip from the subordinates who ventured to correct him, Colonel Maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were eventually rescued by settlers moving inland.Mrs. Merriweather gave a thirty-minute description of Colonel Maycomb\u2019s exploits. I discovered that if I bent my knees I could tuck them under my costume and more or less sit. I sat down, listened to Mrs. Merriweather\u2019s drone and the bass drum\u2019s boom and was soon fast asleep.They said later that Mrs. Merriweather was putting her all into the grand finale, that she had crooned, \u201cPo-ork,\u201d with a confidence born of pine trees and butterbeans entering on cue. She waited a few seconds, then called, \u201cPo-ork?\u201d When nothing materialized, she yelled, \u201cPork!\u201dI must have heard her in my sleep, or the band playing Dixie woke me, but it was when Mrs. Merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that I chose to make my entrance. Chose is incorrect: I thought I\u2019d better catch up with the rest of them.They told me later that Judge Taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood there slapping his knees so hard Mrs. Taylor brought him a glass of water and one of his pills.Mrs. Merriweather seemed to have a hit, everybody was cheering so, but she caught me backstage and told me I had ruined her pageant. She made me feel awful, but when Jem came to fetch me he was sympathetic. He said he couldn\u2019t see my costume much from where he was sitting. How he could tell I was feeling bad under my costume I don\u2019t know, but he said I did all right, I just came in a little late, that was all. Jem was becoming almost as good as Atticus at making you feel right when things went wrong. Almost\u2014not even Jem could make me go through that crowd, and he consented to wait backstage with me until the audience left.\u201cYou wanta take it off, Scout?\u201d he asked.\u201cNaw, I\u2019ll just keep it on,\u201d I said. I could hide my mortification under it.\u201cYou all want a ride home?\u201d someone said.\u201cNo sir, thank you,\u201d I heard Jem say. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little walk.\u201d\u201cBe careful of haints,\u201d the voice said. \u201cBetter still, tell the haints to be careful of Scout.\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t many folks left now,\u201d Jem told me. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWe went through the auditorium to the hallway, then down the steps. It was still black dark. The remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building, and their headlights were little help. \u201cIf some of \u2019em were goin\u2019 in our direction we could see better,\u201d said Jem. \u201cHere Scout, let me hold onto your\u2014hock. You might lose your balance.\u201d\u201cI can see all right.\u201d\u201cYeah, but you might lose your balance.\u201d I felt a slight pressure on my head, and assumed that Jem had grabbed that end of the ham. \u201cYou got me?\u201d\u201cUh huh.\u201dWe began crossing the black schoolyard, straining to see our feet. \u201cJem,\u201d I said, \u201cI forgot my shoes, they\u2019re back behind the stage.\u201d\u201cWell let\u2019s go get \u2019em.\u201d But as we turned around, the auditorium lights went off. \u201cYou can get \u2019em tomorrow,\u201d he said.\u201cBut tomorrow\u2019s Sunday,\u201d I protested, as Jem turned me homeward.\u201cYou can get the janitor to let you in . . . Scout?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n\n</div>"},
{"text": "</p><p>\n\u201cNothing.\u201dJem hadn\u2019t started like that in a long time. I wondered what he was thinking. He\u2019d tell me when he wanted to, probably when we got home. I felt his fingers press the top of my costume, too hard, it seemed. I shook my head. \u201cJem, you don\u2019t hafta\u2014\u201d\u201cHush a minute, Scout,\u201d he said, pinching me.We walked along silently. \u201cMinute\u2019s up,\u201d I said. \u201cWhatcha thinkin\u2019 about?\u201d I turned to look at him, but his outline was barely visible.\u201cThought I heard something,\u201d he said. \u201cStop a minute.\u201dWe stopped.\u201cHear anything?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo.\u201dWe had not gone five paces before he made me stop again.\u201cJem, are you tryin\u2019 to scare me? You know I\u2019m too old\u2014\u201d\u201cBe quiet,\u201d he said, and I knew he was not joking.The night was still. I could hear his breath coming easily beside me. Occasionally there was a sudden breeze that hit my bare legs, but it was all that remained of a promised windy night. This was the stillness before a thunderstorm. We listened.\u201cHeard an old dog just then,\u201d I said.\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Jem answered. \u201cI hear it when we\u2019re walkin\u2019 along, but when we stop I don\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u201cYou hear my costume rustlin\u2019. Aw, it\u2019s just Halloween got you. . . .\u201dI said it more to convince myself than Jem, for sure enough, as we began walking, I heard what he was talking about. It was not my costume.\u201cIt\u2019s just old Cecil,\u201d said Jem presently. \u201cHe won\u2019t get us again. Let\u2019s don\u2019t let him think we\u2019re hurrying.\u201dWe slowed to a crawl. I asked Jem how Cecil could follow us in this dark, looked to me like he\u2019d bump into us from behind.\u201cI can see you, Scout,\u201d Jem said.\u201cHow? I can\u2019t see you.\u201d\u201cYour fat streaks are showin\u2019. Mrs. Crewnshaw painted \u2019em with some of that shiny stuff so they\u2019d show up under the footlights. I can see you pretty well, an\u2019 I expect Cecil can see you well enough to keep his distance.\u201dI would show Cecil that we knew he was behind us and we were ready for him. \u201cCecil Jacobs is a big wet he-en!\u201d I yelled suddenly, turning around.We stopped. There was no acknowledgment save he-en bouncing off the distant schoolhouse wall.\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Jem. \u201cHe-y!\u201dHay-e-hay-e-hay-e, answered the schoolhouse wall.It was unlike Cecil to hold out for so long; once he pulled a joke he\u2019d repeat it time and again. We should have been leapt at already. Jem signaled for me to stop again.He said softly, \u201cScout, can you take that thing off?\u201d\u201cI think so, but I ain\u2019t got anything on under it much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got your dress here.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t get it on in the dark.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cnever mind.\u201d\u201cJem, are you afraid?\u201d\u201cNo. Think we\u2019re almost to the tree now. Few yards from that, an\u2019 we\u2019ll be to the road. We can see the street light then.\u201d Jem was talking in an unhurried, flat toneless voice. I wondered how long he would try to keep the Cecil myth going.\u201cYou reckon we oughta sing, Jem?\u201d\u201cNo. Be real quiet again, Scout.\u201dWe had not increased our pace. Jem knew as well as I that it was difficult to walk fast without stumping a toe, tripping on stones, and other inconveniences, and I was barefooted. Maybe it was the wind rustling the trees. But there wasn\u2019t any wind and there weren\u2019t any trees except the big oak.Our company shuffled and dragged his feet, as if wearing heavy shoes. Whoever it was wore thick cotton pants; what I thought were trees rustling was the soft swish of cotton on cotton, wheek, wheek, with every step.I felt the sand go cold under my feet and I knew we were near the big oak. Jem pressed my head. We stopped and listened.Shuffle-foot had not stopped with us this time. His trousers swished softly and steadily. Then they stopped. He was running, running toward us with no child\u2019s steps.\u201cRun, Scout! Run! Run!\u201d Jem screamed.I took one giant step and found myself reeling: my arms useless, in the dark, I could not keep my balance.\u201cJem, Jem, help me, Jem!\u201dSomething crushed the chicken wire around me. Metal ripped on metal and I fell to the ground and rolled as far as I could, floundering to escape my wire prison. From somewhere near by came scuffling, kicking sounds, sounds of shoes and flesh scraping dirt and roots. Someone rolled against me and I felt Jem. He was up like lightning and pulling me with him but, though my head and shoulders were free, I was so entangled we didn\u2019t get very far.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "We were nearly to the road when I felt Jem\u2019s hand leave me, felt him jerk backwards to the ground. More scuffling, and there came a dull crunching sound and Jem screamed.I ran in the direction of Jem\u2019s scream and sank into a flabby male stomach. Its owner said, \u201cUff!\u201d and tried to catch my arms, but they were tightly pinioned. His stomach was soft but his arms were like steel. He slowly squeezed the breath out of me. I could not move. Suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground, almost carrying me with him. I thought, Jem\u2019s up.One\u2019s mind works very slowly at times. Stunned, I stood there dumbly. The scuffling noises were dying; someone wheezed and the night was still again.Still but for a man breathing heavily, breathing heavily and staggering. I thought he went to the tree and leaned against it. He coughed violently, a sobbing, bone-shaking cough.\u201cJem?\u201dThere was no answer but the man\u2019s heavy breathing.\u201cJem?\u201dJem didn\u2019t answer.The man began moving around, as if searching for something. I heard him groan and pull something heavy along the ground. It was slowly coming to me that there were now four people under the tree.\u201cAtticus . . . ?\u201dThe man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road.I went to where I thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground, reaching out with my toes. Presently I touched someone.\u201cJem?\u201dMy toes touched trousers, a belt buckle, buttons, something I could not identify, a collar, and a face. A prickly stubble on the face told me it was not Jem\u2019s. I smelled stale whiskey.I made my way along in what I thought was the direction of the road. I was not sure, because I had been turned around so many times. But I found it and looked down to the street light. A man was passing under it. The man was walking with the staccato steps of someone carrying a load too heavy for him. He was going around the corner. He was carrying Jem. Jem\u2019s arm was dangling crazily in front of him.By the time I reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard. Light from our front door framed Atticus for an instant; he ran down the steps, and together, he and the man took Jem inside.I was at the front door when they were going down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was running to meet me. \u201cCall Dr. Reynolds!\u201d Atticus\u2019s voice came sharply from Jem\u2019s room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Scout?\u201d\u201cHere she is,\u201d Aunt Alexandra called, pulling me along with her to the telephone. She tugged at me anxiously. \u201cI\u2019m all right, Aunty,\u201d I said, \u201cyou better call.\u201dShe pulled the receiver from the hook and said, \u201cEula May, get Dr. Reynolds, quick!\u201d\u201cAgnes, is your father home? Oh God, where is he? Please tell him to come over here as soon as he comes in. Please, it\u2019s urgent!\u201dThere was no need for Aunt Alexandra to identify herself; people in Maycomb knew each other\u2019s voices.Atticus came out of Jem\u2019s room. The moment Aunt Alexandra broke the connection, Atticus took the receiver from her. He rattled the hook, then said, \u201cEula May, get me the sheriff, please.\u201d\u201cHeck? Atticus Finch. Someone\u2019s been after my children. Jem\u2019s hurt. Between here and the schoolhouse. I can\u2019t leave my boy. Run out there for me, please, and see if he\u2019s still around. Doubt if you\u2019ll find him now, but I\u2019d like to see him if you do. Got to go now. Thanks, Heck.\u201d\u201cAtticus, is Jem dead?\u201d\u201cNo, Scout. Look after her, sister,\u201d he called, as he went down the hall.Aunt Alexandra\u2019s fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire from around me. \u201cAre you all right, darling?\u201d she asked over and over as she worked me free.It was a relief to be out. My arms were beginning to tingle, and they were red with small hexagonal marks. I rubbed them, and they felt better.\u201cAunty, is Jem dead?\u201d\u201cNo\u2014no, darling, he\u2019s unconscious. We won\u2019t know how badly he\u2019s hurt until Dr. Reynolds gets here. Jean Louise, what happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dShe left it at that. She brought me something to put on, and had I thought about it then, I would have never let her forget it: in her distraction, Aunty brought me my overalls. \u201cPut these on, darling,\u201d she said, handing me the garments she most despised.She rushed back to Jem\u2019s room, then came to me in the hall. She patted me vaguely, and went back to Jem\u2019s room.A car stopped in front of the house. I knew Dr. Reynold\u2019s step almost as well as my father\u2019s. He had brought Jem and me into the world, had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the treehouse, and he had never lost our friendship. Dr. Reynolds said if we had been boil-prone things would have been different, but we doubted it.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "He came in the door and said, \u201cGood Lord.\u201d He walked toward me, said, \u201cYou\u2019re still standing,\u201d and changed his course. He knew every room in the house. He also knew that if I was in bad shape, so was Jem.After ten forevers Dr. Reynolds returned. \u201cIs Jem dead?\u201d I asked.\u201cFar from it,\u201d he said, squatting down to me. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bump on the head just like yours, and a broken arm. Scout, look that way\u2014no, don\u2019t turn your head, roll your eyes. Now look over yonder. He\u2019s got a bad break, so far as I can tell now it\u2019s in the elbow. Like somebody tried to wring his arm off . . . now look at me.\u201d\u201cThen he\u2019s not dead?\u201d\u201cNo-o!\u201d Dr. Reynolds got to his feet. \u201cWe can\u2019t do much tonight,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept try to make him as comfortable as we can. We\u2019ll have to X-ray his arm\u2014looks like he\u2019ll be wearing his arm \u2019way out by his side for a while. Don\u2019t worry, though, he\u2019ll be as good as new. Boys his age bounce.\u201dWhile he was talking, Dr. Reynolds had been looking keenly at me, lightly fingering the bump that was coming on my forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel broke anywhere, do you?\u201dDr. Reynolds\u2019s small joke made me smile. \u201cThen you don\u2019t think he\u2019s dead, then?\u201dHe put on his hat. \u201cNow I may be wrong, of course, but I think he\u2019s very alive. Shows all the symptoms of it. Go have a look at him, and when I come back we\u2019ll get together and decide.\u201dDr. Reynolds\u2019s step was young and brisk. Mr. Heck Tate\u2019s was not. His heavy boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same thing Dr. Reynolds said when he came in. \u201cYou all right, Scout?\u201d he added.\u201cYes sir, I\u2019m goin\u2019 in to see Jem. Atticus\u2019n\u2019them\u2019s in there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d said Mr. Tate.Aunt Alexandra had shaded Jem\u2019s reading light with a towel, and his room was dim. Jem was lying on his back. There was an ugly mark along one side of his face. His left arm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the wrong direction. Jem was frowning.\u201cJem . . .?\u201dAtticus spoke. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear you, Scout, he\u2019s out like a light. He was coming around, but Dr. Reynolds put him out again.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d I retreated. Jem\u2019s room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was sitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was standing in a corner, leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not know. He had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it happened. He must have heard our screams and come running.Atticus was standing by Jem\u2019s bed.Mr. Heck Tate stood in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and a flashlight bulged from his pants pocket. He was in his working clothes.\u201cCome in, Heck,\u201d said Atticus. \u201cDid you find anything? I can\u2019t conceive of anyone low-down enough to do a thing like this, but I hope you found him.\u201dMr. Tate sniffed. He glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, then looked around the room\u2014at Jem, at Aunt Alexandra, then at Atticus.\u201cSit down, Mr. Finch,\u201d he said pleasantly.Atticus said, \u201cLet\u2019s all sit down. Have that chair, Heck. I\u2019ll get another one from the livingroom.\u201dMr. Tate sat in Jem\u2019s desk chair. He waited until Atticus returned and settled himself. I wondered why Atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner, but Atticus knew the ways of country people far better than I. Some of his rural clients would park their long-eared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the back yard, and Atticus would often keep appointments on the back steps. This one was probably more comfortable where he was.\u201cMr. Finch,\u201d said Mr. Tate, \u201ctell you what I found. I found a little girl\u2019s dress\u2014it\u2019s out there in my car. That your dress, Scout?\u201d\u201cYes sir, if it\u2019s a pink one with smockin\u2019,\u201d I said. Mr. Tate was behaving as if he were on the witness stand. He liked to tell things his own way, untrammeled by state or defense, and sometimes it took him a while.\u201cI found some funny-looking pieces of muddy-colored cloth\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s m\u2019costume, Mr. Tate.\u201dMr. Tate ran his hands down his thighs. He rubbed his left arm and investigated Jem\u2019s mantelpiece, then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace. His fingers sought his long nose.\u201cWhat is it, Heck?\u201d said Atticus.Mr. Tate found his neck and rubbed it. \u201cBob Ewell\u2019s lyin\u2019 on the ground under that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. He\u2019s dead, Mr. Finch.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "29Aunt Alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. Mr. Tate rose, but she declined assistance. For once in his life Atticus\u2019s instinctive courtesy failed him: he sat where he was.Somehow, I could think of nothing but Mr. Bob Ewell saying he\u2019d get Atticus if it took him the rest of his life. Mr. Ewell almost got him, and it was the last thing he did.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Atticus said bleakly.\u201cHe\u2019s dead all right,\u201d said Mr. Tate. \u201cHe\u2019s good and dead. He won\u2019t hurt these children again.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep. His age was beginning to show, his one sign of inner turmoil: the strong line of his jaw melted a little, one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, one noticed not his jet-black hair but the gray patches growing at his temples.\u201cHadn\u2019t we better go to the livingroom?\u201d Aunt Alexandra said at last.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Mr. Tate, \u201cI\u2019d rather us stay in here if it won\u2019t hurt Jem any. I want to have a look at his injuries while Scout . . . tells us about it.\u201d\u201cIs it all right if I leave?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m just one person too many in here. I\u2019ll be in my room if you want me, Atticus.\u201d Aunt Alexandra went to the door, but she stopped and turned. \u201cAtticus, I had a feeling about this tonight\u2014I\u2014this is my fault,\u201d she began. \u201cI should have\u2014\u201dMr. Tate held up his hand. \u201cYou go ahead, Miss Alexandra, I know it\u2019s been a shock to you. And don\u2019t you fret yourself about anything\u2014why, if we followed our feelings all the time we\u2019d be like cats chasin\u2019 their tails. Miss Scout, see if you can tell us what happened, while it\u2019s still fresh in your mind. You think you can? Did you see him following you?\u201dI went to Atticus and felt his arms go around me. I buried my head in his lap. \u201cWe started home. I said Jem, I\u2019ve forgot m\u2019shoes. Soon\u2019s we started back for \u2019em the lights went out. Jem said I could get \u2019em tomorrow. . . .\u201d\u201cScout, raise up so Mr. Tate can hear you,\u201d Atticus said. I crawled into his lap.\u201cThen Jem said hush a minute. I thought he was thinkin\u2019\u2014he always wants you to hush so he can think\u2014then he said he heard somethin\u2019. We thought it was Cecil.\u201d\u201cCecil?\u201d\u201cCecil Jacobs. He scared us once tonight, an\u2019 we thought it was him again. He had on a sheet. They gave a quarter for the best costume, I don\u2019t know who won it\u2014\u201d\u201cWhere were you when you thought it was Cecil?\u201d\u201cJust a little piece from the schoolhouse. I yelled somethin\u2019 at him\u2014\u201d\u201cYou yelled, what?\u201d\u201cCecil Jacobs is a big fat hen, I think. We didn\u2019t hear nothin\u2019\u2014then Jem yelled hello or somethin\u2019 loud enough to wake the dead\u2014\u201d\u201cJust a minute, Scout,\u201d said Mr. Tate. \u201cMr. Finch, did you hear them?\u201dAtticus said he didn\u2019t. He had the radio on. Aunt Alexandra had hers going in her bedroom. He remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she could hear hers. Atticus smiled. \u201cI always play a radio too loud.\u201d\u201cI wonder if the neighbors heard anything. . . .\u201d said Mr. Tate.\u201cI doubt it, Heck. Most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the chickens. Maudie Atkinson may have been up, but I doubt it.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, Scout,\u201d Mr. Tate said.\u201cWell, after Jem yelled we walked on. Mr. Tate, I was shut up in my costume but I could hear it myself, then. Footsteps I mean. They walked when we walked and stopped when we stopped. Jem said he could see me because Mrs. Crenshaw put some kind of shiny paint on my costume. I was a ham.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d asked Mr. Tate, startled.Atticus described my role to Mr. Tate, plus the construction of my garment. \u201cYou should have seen her when she came in,\u201d he said, \u201cit was crushed to a pulp.\u201dMr. Tate rubbed his chin. \u201cI wondered why he had those marks on him. His sleeves were perforated with little holes. There were one or two little puncture marks on his arms to match the holes. Let me see that thing if you will, sir.\u201dAtticus fetched the remains of my costume. Mr. Tate turned it over and bent it around to get an idea of its former shape. \u201cThis thing probably saved her life,\u201d he said. \u201cLook.\u201dHe pointed with a long forefinger. A shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire. \u201cBob Ewell meant business,\u201d Mr. Tate muttered.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cHe was out of his mind,\u201d said Atticus.\u201cDon\u2019t like to contradict you, Mr. Finch\u2014wasn\u2019t crazy\u2014mean as hell. Low-down skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children. He\u2019d never have met you face to face.\u201dAtticus shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t conceive of a man who\u2019d\u2014\u201d\u201cMr. Finch, there\u2019s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to \u2019em. Even then, they ain\u2019t worth the bullet it takes to shoot \u2019em. Ewell \u2019as one of \u2019em.\u201dAtticus said, \u201cI thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me. Even if he hadn\u2019t, I thought he\u2019d come after me.\u201d\u201cHe had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman, he had guts enough to pester Judge Taylor when he thought the house was empty, so do you think he\u2019da met you to your face in daylight?\u201d Mr. Tate sighed. \u201cWe\u2019d better get on. Scout, you heard him behind you\u2014\u201d\u201cYes sir. When we got under the tree\u2014\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d you know you were under the tree, you couldn\u2019t see thunder out there.\u201d\u201cI was barefooted, and Jem says the ground\u2019s always cooler under a tree.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make him a deputy, go ahead.\u201d\u201cThen all of a sudden somethin\u2019 grabbed me an\u2019 mashed my costume . . . think I ducked on the ground . . . heard a tusslin\u2019 under the tree sort of . . . they were bammin\u2019 against the trunk, sounded like. Jem found me and started pullin\u2019 me toward the road. Some\u2014Mr. Ewell yanked him down, I reckon. They tussled some more and then there was this funny noise\u2014Jem hollered . . .\u201d I stopped. That was Jem\u2019s arm.\u201cAnyway, Jem hollered and I didn\u2019t hear him any more an\u2019 the next thing\u2014Mr. Ewell was tryin\u2019 to squeeze me to death, I reckon . . . then somebody yanked Mr. Ewell down. Jem must have got up, I guess. That\u2019s all I know . . .\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d Mr. Tate was looking at me sharply.\u201cSomebody was staggerin\u2019 around and pantin\u2019 and\u2014coughing fit to die. I thought it was Jem at first, but it didn\u2019t sound like him, so I went lookin\u2019 for Jem on the ground. I thought Atticus had come to help us and had got wore out\u2014\u201d\u201cWho was it?\u201d\u201cWhy there he is, Mr. Tate, he can tell you his name.\u201dAs I said it, I half pointed to the man in the corner, but brought my arm down quickly lest Atticus reprimand me for pointing. It was impolite to point.He was still leaning against the wall. He had been leaning against the wall when I came into the room, his arms folded across his chest. As I pointed he brought his arms down and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall. They were white hands, sickly white hands that had never seen the sun, so white they stood out garishly against the dull cream wall in the dim light of Jem\u2019s room.I looked from his hands to his sand-stained khaki pants; my eyes traveled up his thin frame to his torn denim shirt. His face was as white as his hands, but for a shadow on his jutting chin. His cheeks were thin to hollowness; his mouth was wide; there were shallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, and his gray eyes were so colorless I thought he was blind. His hair was dead and thin, almost feathery on top of his head.When I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, leaving greasy sweat streaks on the wall, and he hooked his thumbs in his belt. A strange small spasm shook him, as if he heard fingernails scrape slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension slowly drained from his face. His lips parted into a timid smile, and our neighbor\u2019s image blurred with my sudden tears.\u201cHey, Boo,\u201d I said.30\u201cMr. Arthur, honey,\u201d said Atticus, gently correcting me. \u201cJean Louise, this is Mr. Arthur Radley. I believe he already knows you.\u201dIf Atticus could blandly introduce me to Boo Radley at a time like this, well\u2014that was Atticus.Boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where Jem was sleeping, for the same shy smile crept across his face. Hot with embarrassment, I tried to cover up by covering Jem up.\u201cAh-ah, don\u2019t touch him,\u201d Atticus said.Mr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. He was about to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall.\u201cEverybody out,\u201d he said, as he came in the door. \u201cEvenin\u2019, Arthur, didn\u2019t notice you the first time I was here.\u201dDr. Reynolds\u2019s voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it every evening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in the same room with Boo Radley. Of course . . . even Boo Radley got sick sometimes, I thought. But on the other hand I wasn\u2019t sure.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Dr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put it down on Jem\u2019s desk and took off his coat. \u201cYou\u2019re quite satisfied he\u2019s alive, now? Tell you how I knew. When I tried to examine him he kicked me. Had to put him out good and proper to touch him. So scat,\u201d he said to me.\u201cEr\u2014\u201d said Atticus, glancing at Boo. \u201cHeck, let\u2019s go out on the front porch. There are plenty of chairs out there, and it\u2019s still warm enough.\u201dI wondered why Atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom, then I understood. The livingroom lights were awfully strong.We filed out, first Mr. Tate\u2014Atticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him. Then he changed his mind and followed Mr. Tate.People have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions. I was no exception: \u201cCome along, Mr. Arthur,\u201d I heard myself saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the house real well. I\u2019ll just take you to the porch, sir.\u201dHe looked down at me and nodded.I led him through the hall and past the livingroom.\u201cWon\u2019t you have a seat, Mr. Arthur? This rocking-chair\u2019s nice and comfortable.\u201dMy small fantasy about him was alive again: he would be sitting on the porch . . . right pretty spell we\u2019re having, isn\u2019t it, Mr. Arthur?Yes, a right pretty spell. Feeling slightly unreal, I led him to the chair farthest from Atticus and Mr. Tate. It was in deep shadow. Boo would feel more comfortable in the dark.Atticus was sitting in the swing, and Mr. Tate was in a chair next to him. The light from the livingroom windows was strong on them. I sat beside Boo.\u201cWell, Heck,\u201d Atticus was saying, \u201cI guess the thing to do\u2014good Lord, I\u2019m losing my memory . . .\u201d Atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his eyes. \u201cJem\u2019s not quite thirteen . . . no, he\u2019s already thirteen\u2014I can\u2019t remember. Anyway, it\u2019ll come before county court\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat will, Mr. Finch?\u201d Mr. Tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward.\u201cOf course it was clear-cut self-defense, but I\u2019ll have to go to the office and hunt up\u2014\u201d\u201cMr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think that?\u201d\u201cYou heard what Scout said, there\u2019s no doubt about it. She said Jem got up and yanked him off her\u2014he probably got hold of Ewell\u2019s knife somehow in the dark . . . we\u2019ll find out tomorrow.\u201d\u201cMis-ter Finch, hold on,\u201d said Mr. Tate. \u201cJem never stabbed Bob Ewell.\u201dAtticus was silent for a moment. He looked at Mr. Tate as if he appreciated what he said. But Atticus shook his head.\u201cHeck, it\u2019s mighty kind of you and I know you\u2019re doing it from that good heart of yours, but don\u2019t start anything like that.\u201dMr. Tate got up and went to the edge of the porch. He spat into the shrubbery, then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced Atticus. \u201cLike what?\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I spoke sharply, Heck,\u201d Atticus said simply, \u201cbut nobody\u2019s hushing this up. I don\u2019t live that way.\u201d\u201cNobody\u2019s gonna hush anything up, Mr. Finch.\u201dMr. Tate\u2019s voice was quiet, but his boots were planted so solidly on the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there. A curious contest, the nature of which eluded me, was developing between my father and the sheriff.It was Atticus\u2019s turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch. He said, \u201cH\u2019rm,\u201d and spat dryly into the yard. He put his hands in his pockets and faced Mr. Tate.\u201cHeck, you haven\u2019t said it, but I know what you\u2019re thinking. Thank you for it. Jean Louise\u2014\u201d he turned to me. \u201cYou said Jem yanked Mr. Ewell off you?\u201d\u201cYes sir, that\u2019s what I thought . . . I\u2014\u201d\u201cSee there, Heck? Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but I don\u2019t want my boy starting out with something like this over his head. Best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open. Let the county come and bring sandwiches. I don\u2019t want him growing up with a whisper about him, I don\u2019t want anybody saying, \u2018Jem Finch . . . his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that.\u2019 Sooner we get this over with the better.\u201d\u201cMr. Finch,\u201d Mr. Tate said stolidly, \u201cBob Ewell fell on his knife. He killed himself.\u201dAtticus walked to the corner of the porch. He looked at the wisteria vine. In his own way, I thought, each was as stubborn as the other. I wondered who would give in first. Atticus\u2019s stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident, but in some ways he was as set as the Cunninghams. Mr. Tate\u2019s was unschooled and blunt, but it was equal to my father\u2019s.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cHeck,\u201d Atticus\u2019s back was turned. \u201cIf this thing\u2019s hushed up it\u2019ll be a simple denial to Jem of the way I\u2019ve tried to raise him. Sometimes I think I\u2019m a total failure as a parent, but I\u2019m all they\u2019ve got. Before Jem looks at anyone else he looks at me, and I\u2019ve tried to live so I can look squarely back at him . . . if I connived at something like this, frankly I couldn\u2019t meet his eye, and the day I can\u2019t do that I\u2019ll know I\u2019ve lost him. I don\u2019t want to lose him and Scout, because they\u2019re all I\u2019ve got.\u201d\u201cMr. Finch,\u201d Mr. Tate was still planted to the floorboards. \u201cBob Ewell fell on his knife. I can prove it.\u201dAtticus wheeled around. His hands dug into his pockets. \u201cHeck, can\u2019t you even try to see it my way? You\u2019ve got children of your own, but I\u2019m older than you. When mine are grown I\u2019ll be an old man if I\u2019m still around, but right now I\u2019m\u2014if they don\u2019t trust me they won\u2019t trust anybody. Jem and Scout know what happened. If they hear of me saying downtown something different happened\u2014Heck, I won\u2019t have them any more. I can\u2019t live one way in town and another way in my home.\u201dMr. Tate rocked on his heels and said patiently, \u201cHe\u2019d flung Jem down, he stumbled over a root under that tree and\u2014look, I can show you.\u201dMr. Tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife. As he did so, Dr. Reynolds came to the door. \u201cThe son\u2014deceased\u2019s under that tree, doctor, just inside the schoolyard. Got a flashlight? Better have this one.\u201d\u201cI can ease around and turn my car lights on,\u201d said Dr. Reynolds, but he took Mr. Tate\u2019s flashlight. \u201cJem\u2019s all right. He won\u2019t wake up tonight, I hope, so don\u2019t worry. That the knife that killed him, Heck?\u201d\u201cNo sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle. Ken oughta be there with the hearse by now, doctor. \u2019night.\u201dMr. Tate flicked open the knife. \u201cIt was like this,\u201d he said. He held the knife and pretended to stumble; as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him. \u201cSee there? Stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs. His whole weight drove it in.\u201dMr. Tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket. \u201cScout is eight years old,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was too scared to know exactly what went on.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Atticus said grimly.\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 she made it up, I\u2019m sayin\u2019 she was too scared to know exactly what happened. It was mighty dark out there, black as ink. \u2019d take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness . . .\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t have it,\u201d Atticus said softly.\u201cGod damn it, I\u2019m not thinking of Jem!\u201dMr. Tate\u2019s boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in Miss Maudie\u2019s bedroom went on. Miss Stephanie Crawford\u2019s lights went on. Atticus and Mr. Tate looked across the street, then at each other. They waited.When Mr. Tate spoke again his voice was barely audible. \u201cMr. Finch, I hate to fight you when you\u2019re like this. You\u2019ve been under a strain tonight no man should ever have to go through. Why you ain\u2019t in the bed from it I don\u2019t know, but I do know that for once you haven\u2019t been able to put two and two together, and we\u2019ve got to settle this tonight because tomorrow\u2019ll be too late. Bob Ewell\u2019s got a kitchen knife in his craw.\u201dMr. Tate added that Atticus wasn\u2019t going to stand there and maintain that any boy Jem\u2019s size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark.\u201cHeck,\u201d said Atticus abruptly, \u201cthat was a switchblade you were waving. Where\u2019d you get it?\u201d\u201cTook it off a drunk man,\u201d Mr. Tate answered coolly.I was trying to remember. Mr. Ewell was on me . . . then he went down. . . . Jem must have gotten up. At least I thought . . .\u201cHeck?\u201d\u201cI said I took it off a drunk man downtown tonight. Ewell probably found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere. Honed it down and bided his time . . . just bided his time.\u201dAtticus made his way to the swing and sat down. His hands dangled limply between his knees. He was looking at the floor. He had moved with the same slowness that night in front of the jail, when I thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair.Mr. Tate clumped softly around the porch. \u201cIt ain\u2019t your decision, Mr. Finch, it\u2019s all mine. It\u2019s my decision and my responsibility. For once, if you don\u2019t see it my way, there\u2019s not much you can do about it. If you wanta try, I\u2019ll call you a liar to your face. Your boy never stabbed Bob Ewell,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cdidn\u2019t come near a mile of it and now you know it. All he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely home.\u201d\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "Mr. Tate stopped pacing. He stopped in front of Atticus, and his back was to us. \u201cI\u2019m not a very good man, sir, but I am sheriff of Maycomb County. Lived in this town all my life an\u2019 I\u2019m goin\u2019 on forty-three years old. Know everything that\u2019s happened here since before I was born. There\u2019s a black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible for it\u2019s dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Let the dead bury the dead.\u201dMr. Tate went to the swing and picked up his hat. It was lying beside Atticus. Mr. Tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on.\u201cI never heard tell that it\u2019s against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed, which is exactly what he did, but maybe you\u2019ll say it\u2019s my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up. Know what\u2019d happen then? All the ladies in Maycomb includin\u2019 my wife\u2019d be knocking on his door bringing angel food cakes. To my way of thinkin\u2019, Mr. Finch, taking the one man who\u2019s done you and this town a great service an\u2019 draggin\u2019 him with his shy ways into the limelight\u2014to me, that\u2019s a sin. It\u2019s a sin and I\u2019m not about to have it on my head. If it was any other man it\u2019d be different. But not this man, Mr. Finch.\u201dMr. Tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot. He pulled his nose, then he massaged his left arm. \u201cI may not be much, Mr. Finch, but I\u2019m still sheriff of Maycomb County and Bob Ewell fell on his knife. Good night, sir.\u201dMr. Tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard. His car door slammed and he drove away.Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. Finally he raised his head. \u201cScout,\u201d he said, \u201cMr. Ewell fell on his knife. Can you possibly understand?\u201dAtticus looked like he needed cheering up. I ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might. \u201cYes sir, I understand,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cMr. Tate was right.\u201dAtticus disengaged himself and looked at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019d be sort of like shootin\u2019 a mockingbird, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201dAtticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it. When he got up and walked across the porch into the shadows, his youthful step had returned. Before he went inside the house, he stopped in front of Boo Radley. \u201cThank you for my children, Arthur,\u201d he said.31When Boo Radley shuffled to his feet, light from the livingroom windows glistened on his forehead. Every move he made was uncertain, as if he were not sure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched. He coughed his dreadful raling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again. His hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He coughed into it, then he wiped his forehead.Having been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had been sitting beside me all this time, present. He had not made a sound.Once more, he got to his feet. He turned to me and nodded toward the front door.\u201cYou\u2019d like to say good night to Jem, wouldn\u2019t you, Mr. Arthur? Come right in.\u201dI led him down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was sitting by Jem\u2019s bed. \u201cCome in, Arthur,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s still asleep. Dr. Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative. Jean Louise, is your father in the livingroom?\u201d\u201cYes ma\u2019am, I think so.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just go speak to him a minute. Dr. Reynolds left some . . .\u201d her voice trailed away.Boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering from a distance at Jem. I took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its whiteness. I tugged him a little, and he allowed me to lead him to Jem\u2019s bed.Dr. Reynolds had made a tent-like arrangement over Jem\u2019s arm, to keep the cover off, I guess, and Boo leaned forward and looked over it. An expression of timid curiosity was on his face, as though he had never seen a boy before. His mouth was slightly open, and he looked at Jem from head to foot. Boo\u2019s hand came up, but he let it drop to his side.\u201cYou can pet him, Mr. Arthur, he\u2019s asleep. You couldn\u2019t if he was awake, though, he wouldn\u2019t let you . . .\u201d I found myself explaining. \u201cGo ahead.\u201dBoo\u2019s hand hovered over Jem\u2019s head.\u201cGo on, sir, he\u2019s asleep.\u201dHis hand came down lightly on Jem\u2019s hair.I was beginning to learn his body English. His hand tightened on mine and he indicated that he wanted to leave.I led him to the front porch, where his uneasy steps halted. He was still holding my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cWill you take me home?\u201dHe almost whispered it, in the voice of a child afraid of the dark.I put my foot on the top step and stopped. I would lead him through our house, but I would never lead him home.\u201cMr. Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. That\u2019s right, sir.\u201dI slipped my hand into the crook of his arm.He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie Crawford was watching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me down the sidewalk, as any gentleman would do.We came to the street light on the corner, and I wondered how many times Dill had stood there hugging the fat pole, watching, waiting, hoping. I wondered how many times Jem and I had made this journey, but I entered the Radley front gate for the second time in my life. Boo and I walked up the steps to the porch. His fingers found the front doorknob. He gently released my hand, opened the door, went inside, and shut the door behind him. I never saw him again.Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbors give in return. We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.I turned to go home. Street lights winked down the street all the way to town. I had never seen our neighborhood from this angle. There were Miss Maudie\u2019s, Miss Stephanie\u2019s\u2014there was our house, I could see the porch swing\u2014Miss Rachel\u2019s house was beyond us, plainly visible. I could even see Mrs. Dubose\u2019s.I looked behind me. To the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window. I walked to it, stood in front of it, and turned around. In daylight, I thought, you could see to the postoffice corner.Daylight . . . in my mind, the night faded. It was daytime and the neighborhood was busy. Miss Stephanie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss Rachel. Miss Maudie bent over her azaleas. It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and the children raced each other to him.It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishing-pole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yard with their friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention.It was fall, and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of Mrs. Dubose\u2019s. The boy helped his sister to her feet, and they made their way home. Fall, and his children trotted to and fro around the corner, the day\u2019s woes and triumphs on their faces. They stopped at an oak tree, delighted, puzzled, apprehensive.Winter, and his children shivered at the front gate, silhouetted against a blazing house. Winter, and a man walked into the street, dropped his glasses, and shot a dog.Summer, and he watched his children\u2019s heart break. Autumn again, and Boo\u2019s children needed him.Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my way home, I felt very old, but when I looked at the top of my nose I could see fine misty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way home, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. He\u2019d be so mad he missed it he wouldn\u2019t speak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grown but there wasn\u2019t much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.I ran up the steps and into the house. Aunt Alexandra had gone to bed, and Atticus\u2019s room was dark. I would see if Jem might be reviving. Atticus was in Jem\u2019s room, sitting by his bed. He was reading a book.\u201cIs Jem awake yet?\u201d\u201cSleeping peacefully. He won\u2019t be awake until morning.\u201d\u201cOh. Are you sittin\u2019 up with him?\u201d\u201cJust for an hour or so. Go to bed, Scout. You\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll stay with you for a while.\u201d\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled by his amiable acquiescence. He was shrewder than I, however: the moment I sat down I began to feel sleepy.\u201cWhatcha readin\u2019?\u201d I asked.Atticus turned the book over. \u201cSomething of Jem\u2019s. Called The Gray Ghost.\u201dI was suddenly awake. \u201cWhy\u2019d you get that one?\u201d\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t know. Just picked it up. One of the few things I haven\u2019t read,\u201d he said pointedly.\n</p>\n</div>"},
{"text": "\u201cRead it out loud, please, Atticus. It\u2019s real scary.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had enough scaring for a while. This is too\u2014\u201d\u201cAtticus, I wasn\u2019t scared.\u201dHe raised his eyebrows, and I protested: \u201cLeastways not till I started telling Mr. Tate about it. Jem wasn\u2019t scared. Asked him and he said he wasn\u2019t. Besides, nothin\u2019s real scary except in books.\u201dAtticus opened his mouth to say something, but shut it again. He took his thumb from the middle of the book and turned back to the first page. I moved over and leaned my head against his knee. \u201cH\u2019rm,\u201d he said, \u201cThe Gray Ghost, by Seckatary Hawkins. Chapter One . . .\u201dI willed myself to stay awake, but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm and his voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that I slept.Seconds later, it seemed, his shoe was gently nudging my ribs. He lifted me to my feet and walked me to my room. \u201cHeard every word you said,\u201d I muttered. \u201c. . . wasn\u2019t sleep at all, \u2019s about a ship an\u2019 Three-Fingered Fred \u2019n\u2019 Stoner\u2019s Boy. . . .\u201dHe unhooked my overalls, leaned me against him, and pulled them off. He held me up with one hand and reached for my pajamas with the other.\u201cYeah, an\u2019 they all thought it was Stoner\u2019s Boy messin\u2019 up their clubhouse an\u2019 throwin\u2019 ink all over it an\u2019 . . .\u201dHe guided me to the bed and sat me down. He lifted my legs and put me under the cover.\u201cAn\u2019 they chased him \u2019n\u2019 never could catch him \u2019cause they didn\u2019t know what he looked like, an\u2019 Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadn\u2019t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .\u201dHis hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me.\u201cMost people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\u201dHe turned out the light and went into Jem\u2019s room. He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.</p>\n\n</div>"}
